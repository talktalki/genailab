## Generating Product Image from Customer Reviews
Our project aims to generate images from textual descriptions using DALL-E, an advanced text-to-image model. We started by using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate text descriptions based on product descriptions and reviews. Then, we used DALL-E to convert these textual descriptions into corresponding images. This approach enhances e-commerce platforms' visual content generation capabilities by automating the process of creating images from raw text.
