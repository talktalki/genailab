## Generating Product Image from Customer Reviews
This project invites you to delve into the intersection of text and image generation. The goal is to
use a LLM to extract valuable information from the textual content of the product customer reviews,
followed by leveraging a diffusion model to re-create product images based on the customer reviews.
This task not only tests the generative capabilities of AI in its understanding and interpretative
abilities in extracting visual cues from texts, but also its ability in producing relevant visual content
based on these visual cues.
