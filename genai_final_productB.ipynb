Will make a great addition to any room.', \"For whatever reason, I was expecting this to be a poster (sometimes I do late night shopping when I can't sleep and don't fully read the descriptions). Pleasantly surprised that it was printed canvas. Brings a beautiful pop of color to my bedroom. I think I want to get another one for my classroom because I love it so much!\", \"I bought this in 24x36 to mount in the eaves of my house outdoors. Before hanging it I reinforced the wood frame on the back with L brackets and T brackets. Then I overcoated it front and back with an industrial waterproofer and UV spray.
