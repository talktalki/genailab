Zippers work easily and has a convenient TSA approved lock.  Looks great and will be perfect size for longer trips.  Happy with the purchase / great value for the money.', 'When the pull-out handle stopped working on my dinosaur fabric carry-on during a recent trip to Belize, I finally realized it was time to replace it. Samsonite has always deserved the brand awareness it has earned as being a top brand in luggage. My parents always used it. Our old Samsonite hard shelled luggage never failed after years of car trips all throughout the west.This was the main reason I chose this brand. I’ve now have had 4 trips on it, and it has lived up to its reputation. The luggage is very light, yet the Polycarbonate shell is very tough. It doesn’t deform after being tossed around and really doesn’t show scratches. Best Features:• The mesh and elastic straps keep things neatly in place.• The expandable feature lets you add a lot more stuff (while still fitting in the overhead bin).• The wheels are very well made and roll smoothly over bumps, carpet, escalator ribs and up ramps.• The TSA locks are designed very smartly.• Zippers are STRONG.• The Caribbean Blue looks really cool and totally stands out. You can’t miss it in the luggage carousel.• Well worth spending the extra bucks on something that will last a long time.• I rate this a definite BUY!', \"Samsonite Omni PC Hardside Spinner 20, Caribbean Blue, One SizeMy last carry on suitcase served me well for over 12 years, accompanying me on countless trips, usually over-stuffed, through winter weather, through slush and rain and dragged across the cobble-stone streets in Berlin. In the last couple years it began to show it's age, but it wasn't until the handle finally ripped off and the inner lining tore a small hole on my most recent trip that I admitted it was finally time to move on.My initial inclination was to buy something cheap - I don't need fancy luggage, I got student loans to pay... So I was poking around and looking at options in the $30 - $40 market, and there were some that looked ok. But then I would dig into the reviews and read about them breaking on the first trip, or having stuck wheels or finicky handles... Not feeling satisfied I put off the purchase for a while. I went to a store and looked at some of these models in person, and I was startled by how flimsy they felt in person. They were not built to handle the abuse of transatlantic air-travel. Feeling ambivalent, I put off the decision yet again.Fast forward to Tuesday of this week, no suitcase purchased, my flight is Friday morning. I pull my old trusty carry-on out of storage and seriously debate taking it on one last journey... just one more time?? The suitcase does not want. So I come back to Amazon and search again until I find this suitcase. It's not super cheap, but it's not expensive either, and it has a great color, and good reviews, and it sturdy in the photos... I'm still undecided, but, well, clock is ticking, I bite the bullet.Suitcase arrived just in time for my flight :-) My roommate carried the box upstairs for me this afternoon and when I thanked her, commented on how light it was. As soon as I open it I am relieved, this is a strong and sturdy suitcase, and it looks smart. The handle is long, and slides out easily, doesn't rattle around like those other flimsier models did. Wheels are seemingly good quality. The body looks quite durable and scratch resistant, the zipper is good quality, oh and there's even a lock. It holds a lot of stuff for how small it is, and it is expandable which is helpful for people who sometimes overpack.UPDATE: Suitcase held up perfectly over 4 four flights over the holidays, on two of which it actually had to be checked because the flight was very full. Not a single scratch or dent, no signs of wear, and it was easy to travel with - rolled smoothly and easily, sturdy handle.\", 'This is a very good quality suitcase.  It was the first hard case that I\\'ve bought.  For the most part, I am satisfied, but I wish I had known a couple more bits of information before I purchased.  If you are also buying YOUR FIRST HARD CASE, read these IMPORTANT TIPS.  TIP #1: This case closes with a ZIPPER ONLY.  It does not have a latch.  Zipper-only hard cases are more vulnerable to malfunction because zippers can break or split apart with stress or excessive wear.  If the zipper splits on this case, you do will have a latch as a backup method to keep your case closed and you may find your self in a predicament when you need to check your broken-zippered bag at the airport.  Therefore, if you buy this case, be sure to also buy luggage straps.  Luggage straps are extremely effective to keep your case closed and will help prevent excessive stress or damage to the zipper.  When buying luggage straps, write your initials on each strap with a permanent marker.  This will not only help identify your bag in a busy airport, but also make the straps less desirable for thieves.  TIP #2: I bought the (very large) 28-inch version of this case because I wanted to have plenty of space to pack for long international trips.  In hindsight, I wish I had bought a size or two smaller because filling up a case this big with normal items like clothing, shoes, and toiletries will almost always put you over the airline weight limits (and be very heavy to lift).  The case is very light, but I can only fill it up about 75% to avoid paying the \"excess weight\" fees.  With the case being 25% empty, I have lots of open space in the bag and my belongings bounce around inside.  When I arrive at my destination, I often find my loosely packed belongings out of order and disheveled.  For my next suitcase, I will buy something a tad bit smaller so I can fill 90% or 100%.  When filled to 90-100%, my belongings would be tightly packed and more secure inside.', 'Awesome color, package arrived without an issue. Texture feels amazing, basic compartments with good space and the wheel test was 10/10. This thing can almost roll by themselves.', \"So far so good; I've flown on 4 international flights and 12 domestic (USA) since I bought. Hasn't seem to scuff or dented anywhere and haven't had anything break on it. Only drawback I did notice was it doesn't allow things to adhere to the material easily; for example stickers or tape. Is a great size to fit everything and the separate compartments work well. Only thing I would advise is maybe an improvement on the zipper on the one mesh screen side. Overall is quality luggage that has done the job for me many times for my business trips.\", \"I purchased the Samsonite Omni PC Hardside Expandable Luggage 3-Piece Set probably 2 years ago, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This luggage set has truly exceeded my expectations in several ways.Durability: The hardside design of this luggage is incredibly robust and has withstood the rigors of travel exceptionally well. After numerous trips, there's hardly a scratch to be found, and the luggage still looks as good as new.Spaciousness: The three different sizes provide ample space for packing, whether it's a short weekend getaway or a more extended vacation. The expandable feature is a lifesaver when I come back with more souvenirs than I initially planned.Maneuverability: The spinner wheels make navigating airports and crowded terminals a breeze. They glide smoothly in all directions, eliminating the need to tip or drag heavy luggage.Security: The built-in TSA-approved combination locks provide peace of mind when checking in luggage. It's reassuring to know that my belongings are secure.Organization: The interior compartments and dividers help keep my items organized during transit. It's easy to find what I need without rummaging through everything.Stylish Design: The sleek and modern design of this luggage set adds a touch of sophistication to my travels.In summary, the Samsonite Omni PC Hardside Expandable Luggage 3-Piece Set is an outstanding investment for travelers. It combines durability, functionality, and style, making it an excellent choice for anyone who values quality luggage. I highly recommend this set to fellow travel enthusiasts.\", \"Let me start by saying I am a longtime Samsonite fan. All of my luggage has been Samsonite. I travel a-l-o-t for work and have loved the Samsonite brand for durability and travel smarts. Well, so far, this luggage set seems to be pretty durable but as far as the travel smarts... they missed the mark when it comes to the wheels.Let's start with the Good. I went with hard-sided this time as these are the polycarbonate which hold up far better to the grind of being thrown around by luggage handlers at the airports. From all of my reading, the non-polycarbonate type just don't hold up to that. Not to mention, much of my type of travel (I work in the film industry) is in and out of cars, along side my kit and other gear being loaded in and out... so lots of tossing and banging around. And they have held up like a champ so far (about a year of ownership so far & many, many trips since). Since they are hard sided, they lack the various external pockets that their non-hard sided counterparts have, but that is par for the course and is a trade-off for the durability.  They do have a much better clothing strap system inside than my previous Samsonite luggage. It really seems to hold everything in place far better and snug. In addition, on the one side has that typical zippered net closure as well. All three pieces have the expandability zippers and surprisingly (for this consummate overpacker), I don't need to utilize them much... nice to have though.One sort of wonky thing for me is, that they have an integrated TSA compatible lock that the zippers connect into, with a combination you can set. It's wonky because I have a difficult time with it. Maybe it's because of the length of my nails as I keep them fairly long, I have no idea. And it's not that I can't use it, I just seem to fight with it, especially the combination dials. Some may not have issues with it... might just be me.My biggest issue is the wheels... they just stink. I mean, horrible. The only ones that are somewhat okay, are on the biggest suitcase, but even that.. they just don't wheel great. Especially on any sort of carpet or textured surface... which is well, many surfaces you are rolling it on.  And when you get any sort of bump... like a transition at a doorway, forget it... they just won't go over it.  And the smaller suitcases? Ugh... just awful for wheeling. Most people like to or Need to attach some other bag to the handle of their main suitcase. Whether that be a toiletry bag, a computer bag a backpack or something else.... I haven't found one that doesn't want to dump the suitcase over. And trying to roll them, with something on top, attached to handle is like pushing it through quicksand. The concept that these are supposed to be spinner wheels is completely lost. You are constantly fighting it!  I literally give up and use them all like an old school suitcase that only has two wheels! Which defeats the purpose of buying a suitcase set with spinner wheels. And the smaller the suitcase, the worse it gets. The largest suitcase, when it's full... it's very difficult for me to use in a non-upright position as it's heavy. It's easier to roll as it has more weight to it (when full), but it's still difficult. Samsonite definitely missed the mark with these wheels. It's sad as it's the first luggage set I've not really been happy with.I'm just fortunate that most of my travel is by car and I usually have a cart with me for my mobile office so it's not as important. If I was traveling more by plane... I'd really be annoyed and probably would have returned it. The wheels are just horrible. So if you are traveling a lot where the wheels on the suitcase are expressly important.. make sure you test these out sufficiently or just try something else, as much as this Samsonite fan is pained to say that.\", 'This is one of the most spacious AND lightest carry-on rollers on the market. I can easily pack 5 days worth of clothes in this suit case. Two things that caused me not to give it 5 stars:1. The wheels aren’t great. Immediately I noticed that and it wasn’t as smooth as my TravelPro. Reading the reviews, you’ll see that, and bad wheels can lead to future problems if you ever take this suitcase on anything other than a smooth indoor floor. I decided to buy nice (roller-blade like) wheels with sealed bearings. You’ll need 43x18mm to fit this suitcase. Also, you’ll need a hacksaw to remove the old wheels. There’s YouTube videos out there if you need help.2. The collapsing handle has a lot of give in it and the original wheels will make it worse overtime. There are some internal screws that you can tighten. Also, you don’t need to fully extend the handle when in use. Pull it all the way up, then drop it down one notch. This reduces the “wobblyness” in the handle.With these adjustments, this is a great suitcase in the $100 range. The finish is nice and does not scuff like the Away and Monos that are $250 and higher. My wife has the Monos equivalent to mine and it is a superb piece of luggage at more than twice the price as my Samsonite. That being said, I’m now extremely happy with this Samsonite after the upgraded wheels.', 'I bought this luggage for an upcoming 2-week trip. I love the color, but I also did some research before making my purchase. Samsonite makes quality luggage and I read that a hard-sided luggage is more durable than what I usually use. I hope to have this luggage last me a very long time and I will do it in style. The radiant pink color will stand out, make it easy to spot, and it is pretty. The luggage is very roomy, has the expandable feature, locks, and wheel. I love it!', 'I’ve owned this for a month or so now. I’ve been on about 15 flights or so and it seems to be holding up. It does seem very resistant to scratches. The wheels could certainly be better. Sometimes, they don’t roll as smoothly as expected. The wheels are plastic, showing a lot of wear already and I envision that they’ll be the first to go. I haven’t had any trouble with the handle, but it doesn’t feel strong. I knew I would be traveling a lot and samsonite offered a 10 year warranty, which was a big motive for my purchase.', 'This suitcase has served me well for the last year and a half. On my last trip, one of the wheels fell off. I was disappointed but decided to try to fix it myself. Unfortunately, the part where the wheel attached to the suitcase had deformed when the screws came out, so it had structural damage.  Little did I realize st the time how good samsonite’s warranty is. I dropped off my luggage at the local Samsonite store on Easter Sunday, paid the $20 deductible, and by Wednesday afternoon I had an email stating the suitcase was fixed and on its way back. I can’t fault a company that stands behind what it sells.', 'I am heading out on my trip next week so I will let you know if it holds up. This is my first luggage purchase in 15 years. My other was a soft case - 30 inch and I took it every where until the zipper finally broke. Hoping this Hard case will hold the next 15!', 'We were looking for a hard, carry-on turquoise, rolling suitcase. That’s just what we got!  A gift for our granddaughter’s 12th birthday, this was perfect - more space than a kids bag, fun, good quality, something that should last for years. We had it in 2 days, just as pictured and described and not available locally.', 'Granted I’ve only used it once for a weeklong trip, but I believe it’s going to be the best piece of luggage I’ve ever bought. Durable, lightweight, lots of storage space, rolls incredible, and I love the TSA-Approved lock.', 'Very good, the biggest one is too big, when I put so many stuff, the weight was much bigger than plane ✈️ allowed, but it is not problem. Wheels works good, really scratch resistance.', 'It is a very durable suitcase.  Rolled nicely but not as nicely as others.  You can get a lot of stuff in it!', 'Bought both a set for myself and my mother- I travel a lot with these and the most important thing is that they have an expansion zipper for when you overpack.  Not all hard shells have this.  They are also light weight, roll well have held up to multiple trips, I like having 3 sizes.  Have mostly used the medium and smallest one, but the big one is great for ski trips and bulky clothes or for car travel where weight doesn\\'t matter.  Heads up, for infrequent travelers, when you use expansion zippers though, always carry a fold up (cloth type) bag in carry on as overflow control in case you get on a small plane and need to pull stuff out so your bag fits.  Not all carry on will fit in overhead if you use expansion zippers (tip from \"it happened to me\" lessons)', 'I took this thing on my Uganda mission trip and it held up the 30 hours of travel time there and the 30 hours back. Only reason I gave it a 4 star is because the wheels are a bit too small and if you try to roll a backpack on it while in the airport it can tip easy, but everything else was what I needed!! It’s the perfect weekend suitcase too!', \"The luggage seems lightweight but sturdy, and I have high hopes for it's durability for travel. The only thing I'm docking a star for is that I ordered white and received a blue. I already have a white carry-on size and was hoping to have a matching set.\", 'Just used for a 9 day trip to punta cana. Perfect and sturdy. Nothing broke. Beautiful esthetically. Fits as carry on in overhead on plane. So happy with purchase after scary reviews of wheels breaking on other brands', 'I doing a lot of traveling all over the world and need a suitcase that is light but big enough to pack clothes for 3 to 4 weeks at a time.', 'We use this one, taking a trip overseas and wanting to pack lite. This fit perfectly in the overhead bins even on the European airlines. It was easy to roll and lightweight.', \"I bought two of these sets in white. They arrived as expected and matched the description. A few observations:- The white color is not pure white. It is more of an off-white, with a slight blue tinge to it. This was the biggest surprise. I still like its visibility on the airport luggage carousel, but I would have liked it to be pure bright white.- I took two European trips with it and noticed some damage to the shell (a small crack). I know airlines are rough on luggage, but I was hoping it would be undamaged for much longer.- Obviously, an off-white color means that it gets dirty quickly, and it does. There were lots of black scuff marks, but I was expecting that, and they would probably clean off quickly.- This is fine with this particular luggage/brand or model, but more a general problem for this size of luggage: The larger size is massive, as big as it is allowed by most airlines. You will likely not be able to fill it without going over 50 lbs. You will hit the weight limit well before you hit the size limit.  Bringing two large ones and a medium one (remember, I bought two sets) made it challenging to fit in UberXL cars, and I had to rent full-size station wagons (annoying when driving in Europe) and it was still challenging to fit.In conclusion, if I could choose again, I'd buy a set with a smaller large size and look for something pure-white color. I also might find something with a more robust shell, but I realize it would probably be heavier.\", 'Solamente la use un regreso en avión y está lo más bien.Es amplia, fácil de llevar.Pero la cerradura no parece ser tan buena xq en un video de la abre muy fácilmente con un accesorio xa celular, el que extrae la memoria', 'We were going on a cruise and everyone needed new luggage.

It looks nice and rolls well.  Time will tell how well it holds up.  The main negative is that it's mainly just two huge compartments without any separate dividers or pockets.

Colorful and durable. I travel frequently. These are great in the 3 different sizes. Plenty of room. Wheels and zipper have been durable. Excellent purchase.', 'My mother loved it! Nice color as well', \"PROS- I have traveled to several international destinations, and used this as both carry on and checked luggage. I have taken this on several city streets, and road trips. It's held up well.- It's lightweight, and doesn't waste space in the interior with the design.- It always fit in the overhead bin- The wheels don't get in the way of zipping (I've heard some people complain about inadvertently touching wheels because of the design on some cases, but I've never experienced that with this one).- It's usually the distinctive one on the conveyer belt (color), but I also use a distinctive luggage tag.- Pricepoint is spot on for the use I have had out of it so far and how it's held up so far.CONS- even this small version can be packed beyond acceptable weight limits because it's quite roomy (and I also use compression packing cubes), so be mindful of that depending on the airline's restrictions for carry on and overhead size.- The wheels are good, but could be better. They become troubled when you walk too fast, and if you try and put a bag on top of the case. It's still maneuverable, but have to be more careful. The weight makes a difference.\", 'Haven’t used yet, but I’m happy so far with purchase.  Like darker color without being black.  Good size with expandable sides.', 'Just like I expected 👌 however the wheels could work better', 'My son , and his girlfriend told me about this suit case. They love it when they go on their trips', 'I intended to wait to write the review till after I had used this case a few times, but it’s such a great little case I couldn’t wait. It is very spacious inside, it’s lightweight, and the wheels spin perfectly. Plus, I received Fed Exed notification for delivery date. Who does that! Someone very considerate.', 'Now that I\\'ve had the chance to travel with this, I can finally give my full review. I purchased the carry-on size for a trip overseas and based on the reviews, I chose this particular carry-on size since most people shared that it fits the overhead bins of most airlines. Obviously, double-check YOUR specific airline before purchasing, just to be safe!So let\\'s start with the COLOR - I opted for the \"Caribbean Blue\" color and it is a very noticeable shade of blue, which was great since I was able to identify my suitcase as it went through security and as I also checked it during my flight back home. In terms of DESIGN - this is a hardshell case and it is quite sturdy. I have been a loyal Samsonite customer for years and so I had good faith in the quality and design of this suitcase. The suitcase does come with a TSA-approved lock system, which you use by setting your own code.I was able to easily navigate the luggage. However, the WHEELS at some point were a bit awkward. When rolling it sideways, sometimes there was a weird lag to it, but otherwise, it was able to smoothly roll through carpet, tile, and whatever surface I put it through haha.Now to the important part - STORAGE - I am an over-packer, and yes, I did need to EXPAND this suitcase to accommodate my clothes and shoes. initially, I had used packing cubes but found it too clunky and took up too much space and therefore, simply opted for the rolling method instead.So as a CARRY-ON, even when expanded this suitcase did fit my JetBlue overhead compartment. I was super nervous that it wouldn\\'t but thank heavens it did! As a CHECKED BAG, this survived the brutality of the luggage carousel and the manhandling from the airport workers and I was so happy that it came back to me in tact.Overall, I am very pleased with this suitcase and cannot wait to use it some more for future trips to come! Highly recommend!', 'Perfect', 'Came fairly quickly.  Have not used it on a trip yet, but it looks like it will be able to fit quite a few things in it!', 'We have been looking for a size large luggage for international travel and this one is the best for maneuverability and cost. The spinner wheels are great and quality and can handle heavy loads. Samsonite has an excellent warranty and I like the bright colors since it makes finding our luggage really easy in the airport. I will purchase a small size that matches in color.', 'Rolls well easy to use seems like a good quality so far after a few trips.', 'Light weight and easy color to spot. Holding up well to airline use. A nice size-bigger than a carry-on but not an extra-large one. Very pleased with this luggage.', 'It rolls so easily', 'Very good product', 'Great product and love the look.', 'I purchased the 3 pieces set because the 29\" expandable was not available by itself in the color I wanted in the time I needed it.  I was surprised at how light this suitcase is and also, being so big, easy to handle.  I was able to fit everything I needed and still had plenty of room without having to expand it.  I feel that if you expand such a big suitcase, it may become less stable and harder to move around.  Keep in mind that these wonderful spinner wheels are made to run smoothly only on airport surfaces - no rugs, or sidewalks.  I had a slightly more difficult time rolling it from the parking lot to the terminal as the road surfaces are rougher and less even.  Aside from that, it makes a world of a difference to use a spinner rather than the traditional 2 wheeled suitcases.  I own a fabric Travel Pro set that is in very good shape and I have used for many years but it has 2 wheels and it is much heavier - so time to upgrade.  I am happy with  my purchase.  As far as the dimensions, I don\\'t know who took them - I was worried that the 29 inch would be too big and I would have to pay over size charges but NOPE.  I  measured it right out of the box and the overall dimensions including the wheels was 61 inches (length + width + height) which is under the 62\" maximum required by the airlines.  I packed stuff for 8 days and even though I was allowed 70 lb. in my checked baggage, I was only at 62 lbs.  The weight of the suitcase itself is a big help.  I did see a few superficial scratches on it, only after the first trip, but it is to be expected.  I am not worried about scratches - they are inevitable - in my opinion.  So with that said, I will most likely end up buying another set for my husband.  The carryon is also the perfect size and I was pleasantly surprised at how much stuff I can fit in it.  I used to to stuff all the heavy goodies I bought abroad, including liquids, and I checked it as a regular bag.  The medium 25\" is a good size - no so medium - more like a large suitcase but I have not used it yet.  I believe the 25\" is most likely going to be my clothing suitcase and the larger one will be the everything else and souvenir b ag - as it holds tons of stuff.  Very happy with my purchase.', 'After 10 years i changed one samsonite to another', 'I got this suitcase for traveling, love it!  Samsonite has the very best quality and I knew I could count on getting a top notch product. I received it in a timely manner as well.', \"I'm very indecisive and when I got this piece of luggage it fit everything I needed for an upcoming trip, but I ended up returning it.

Combo  locks great for my upcoming trips, durable no issues or problems.', \"Update:  Held up so far, taking it through various cities.  I figured out how to work the lock but only after searching and watching several videos.The reason why I bought it was for the lock feature, and it doesn't come with any instructions how to operate the lock.  There looks to be a keyhole but no key.  I watched a Youtube video, but it was for an older model.  The material feels like it could crack easily if enough force is put on it.  Will be testing it next month when I go on a trip.  Will update.\", \"Product is fine - it's the return fee of almost $22 that is the aggravating part.

The only thing that needs to be fixed about it is, there is no strap to put it with my checked luggage.', 'What I like most about this bag is that it is lightweight, holds more than I anticipated, has a narrow retractable handle, and is easy to maneuver. It is a replacement for a fabric suitcase with only 2 wheels and a wide retractable handle that can’t accommodate my new sleeved carry-on.  I just used it for the the first time though and was not pleased with the way it rolled with the additional weight of the other bag.  Without the bag it was much easier to maneuver.  If I had it to do over, I would have purchased a bag with heavier duty double rolling wheels.  I still recommend this suitcase though—it just depends on how you intend to use it.', 'I bought this suitcase for my sister. She was so excited to receive it—it was everything she wanted. And then she made the mistake of locking it. Even though she wrote down the number, she made the mistake of closing the suitcase to check the lock. Well, the lock wouldn’t unlock. She had to have the lock cut out because she was leaving the next day. If you make the same mistake, make sure you leave enough time between testing the lock and your trip so you can go to a licensed Samsonite dealer to undo the lock.', 'Finally got the chance to use this luggage set.  Just spent nearly a month touring Europe with this set.  We flew to Paris from Chicago.  Then we flew from Paris to Madrid and then from Madrid to Rome.  Then we took trains all over Italy, a cruise throughout Greece and some other stops in Monaco and France.  We carried not only enough clothes for a long trip but we also got married in the Greek Islands so we also had a wedding gown and tux in here as well.  To say that our luggage needed to be spacious, easily maneuverable, and strong enough to bear up to that much travel without wrecking our clothes is an understatement.  We chose Samsonite as my previous set was 16 years old and still going strong.  To see how the all wheel luggage performed we went to a nearby Samsonite store.  The ultra lite series seemed entirely too flimsy for our needs and we decided on this set.  I read all the reviews online and, despite being concerned about the one review I saw about the large bag being beyond regulation size, I ordered this set.  Now on the other side of our trip I can tell you not once did any airline mention the bag\\'s total dimensions (to be honest I\\'ve never seen an airline baggage handler with a tape measure and really think they only care if it makes weight) and how many times we discussed during the trip how great this luggage set had performed.  We planned at the start that we would pack without unzipping the 2\" extensions to start and would know we had bought enough souvenirs once all three bags had been extended.  It all worked exactly as planned.  The bags were sturdy and well balanced.  We were easily able to put our backpacks and carryon bags on top of these and not need to keep a hold of them to keep them from tipping.  We did get one scratch on the large bag but it is not really noticeable.  Hope this long review helps as I was on the fence from the previous reviews on whether to buy or not and knew I would give this set the great review it deserved once home.', 'We had purchased the larger size last year, which worked well for our longer trip.  Decided to order the smaller one for other trips', 'Just bought this luggage and had it delivered January 18, 2024. Loved the appearance of it.  Looks durable, but looks are deceiving.  First time using, getting ready to leave on a cruise, and the handle broke even though the bag only weighed 44 pounds. Now I have to ship the product to a repair center at my own expense, even though it is brand new, since there are no authorized repair centers within 300 miles. Bought Samsonite because of the reputation and it is what we were replacing.  Will think twice before buying Samsonite again.', 'Light, strong, wheels correctly', \"The Samsonite Omni PC Hardside Expandable Luggage is not just a suitcase. Oh no, it's the diva of airport runways, the unmissable flamingo in a sea of luggage monotony. The color? Let's just call it Radiant Pink or 'Where’s-My-Sunglasses-At' Pink!This 24-inch checked-medium luggage doesn't just hold clothes, it gobbles them up. I packed two weeks' worth of vacation outfits, a hoard of beach towels, three novels, and I'm pretty sure I lost my Chihuahua in there at some point. (Don't worry, Fifi was found safe and sound hiding in a shoe.)The hard-shell exterior is tougher than a diamond-coated armadillo. It took the full brunt of airport baggage handling like a champion, emerging on the carousel unscathed and gleaming like a pink beacon of victory. It scoffs at rough handling, chuckles at scratches, and has a hearty laugh at dents.And the spinner wheels! They should have their own Olympic event. They spun so smoothly, I half expected the suitcase to break into an ice-skating routine right there in the airport terminal. Whether we were making a mad dash for the gate or gracefully sidestepping foot traffic, this suitcase twirled with the grace of a prima ballerina.As for the expandable feature, it's like a magic trick. I'm talking rabbits-out-of-hats level of sorcery. It swallowed my impromptu holiday purchases with room to spare. I suspect it secretly leads to Narnia.All in all, if you're looking to travel in style, the Samsonite Omni PC Hardside Expandable Luggage is your ticket to ride. Not only will you have enough room for everything but the kitchen sink, but you'll also be the proud owner of the most dazzlingly pink suitcase this side of the galaxy.

Worked out very well for vacation.', 'Samsonite has always been our go to for quality luggage.', 'Travel', 'I am elderly and this luggage could have better wheels to move about, make turns, and go over small bumps. I think because of the single wheels. I found that even slowing down my pace did not make moving it easier whether on carpet or smooth flooring at the airport.

This specific model has been very durable and while it has some minor scratches and scuff marks, everything is still working great! Highly recommend and will purchase another set.\", 'I love the unique color. It helps at airports to have luggage that stands out. The only problem is durability.

Once the handle is in place it isn't easy to remove. You shouldn't be removing the handle once it's installed anyways. Note a small tool is included for tightening screws on scooter as needed in the future.The two-in-one style is great. My little one is still learning how to use a scooter while standing up and maneuver/turning while going. You have to use your weight to propel the turn correctly. Sometimes it can be frustrating to her and when this happens she can still enjoy it in the sitting position.The scooter is well made. There's no rough edges! The wheels light up in rainbow lights when you make the scooter go which is really cool!It's pretty easy to take the scooter from standing to sitting position. It's also not difficult for an adult to adjust the handlebar for the height of the child.Though this doesn't fold up flat, it takes up very little space in our storage area and in bringing along in the car.I love the value as this scooter can be used from age 1-14 give or take. Recommended!\", 'Got this for My Granddaughter She loves it !Holds  Up  really well!! Definitely Recommend! Great Price! Fast Delivery!! She’s 4 !! East to put together!!', \"I got this scooter for my 2 year old grandson who has been trying to use his older brother's scooter and getting frustrated. I selected this unit based on the good reviews and competitive price, in addition to the ability to use the scooter sitting or standing. Overall I've been happy so far.Assembly is very easy, almost idiot proof, connect the handle to the base and your done. The handle is held in place by a small plastic pin but seems very stable and secure so far. I used the allen wrench they supplied to tighten everything that could be tightened, but overall assembly was done in less than 10 minutes. The seat can be removed, or the height changed, with a nut and both designed to be tightened by hand, without the tool. I did have one issue with this unit, with the seat. The seat does not sit entirely aligned with the foot plate. It is just a bit  off center, but enough that you can see it when looking at the seat from above. As if the holes on the handle bar were drilled just slightly off lone. So far it has not been an issue, and the use of the unit has not been affected, but it is something to be aware of. Its not something I am going to return the unit for.The switch from sitting to standing has been seem less so far with adult help, the seat is a bit to tight for a toddler to full lift up and press down. Seat height adjustment is quick and easy, as is the ability to unclamp the handle bar and change the height up or down. The wheels light up and roll smoothly, as they are supposed to do. There are foot rests at the base where the handle bar attaches to the foot plate, but I can't see a time those are ever going to be used. The brakes work when in standing position, but your child won't be able to get to them when sitting on the seat as they are directly behind you. My grandson just uses the bottoms of his shoes like his brother does.I rated this as 4 stars due to the alignment issue with the seat as that is a quality control issue, both of on the manufacturing side and with the quality control inspection which should have caught it. Otherwise I would have rated this as a 5 star purchase.\", 'Got 2 of these for my four year old and two year old. They both love it especially the little seat option.

Perfect!\", 'Gracias excelente artículo súper recomendados', \"The scooter is very beautiful and the lights on the wheels light up which makes it fun for my daughter. If your child does not know how to ride the scooter its ok because the seat makes it very helpful for them to sit and use their legs and learn how to balance and maneuver it. Love the foot rest at the front when they are tired or just want mom/dad to push them. Little downside it that the handle bars don't move left or right like a regular scooter they have to move with their body the direction they want to go but it is not difficult to do so. Overall amazing scooter and my daughter loves it!!\", 'The feature on how to lean and turn took a bit to get hang of but my daughter does enjoy her scooter!', \"I was so excited to get this scooter. My little and I opened the box to find that it was damaged in multiple places.  If there are going to be nicks and scrapes on this scooter It should be because one of us put it there.  I was definitely disappointed.  I will be returning.*Update - I returned the damaged product and was sent a new one within a few days.  I had a problem putting the top into the base.  I kept pushing it down but it wouldn't click into place.  Finally I turned it over and pinched the place where the pieces are supposed to click together and it worked.  The little human loves it.

The seat makes it easy for her to use til she can learn how to use it without the seat.', \"I brought this for my grandson because I thought he would like it. But as soon as he saw it, he wanted to ride on it. It's built well sturdy and easy to assemble. The handle bar doesn't turn which is easy to steer for little ones, which helps them not to crash into things. The wheels lite up when they are riding it, which they love. To make turn they have to lean left or right to make turn. If you have a little ones that want scooter than this one will make a good choice for their first scooter.\", 'It’s cute and would know my daughter would love it but she’s a bit heavy now for a one year old so when she sits down the sit moves out of place so I would always have to adjust it.

It is good looking and sturdy. He is going to love it.', 'We purchased this product for our 5 year old daughter and it worked great as a first scooter for her to learn and gain confidence with. My ONLY complaint would be that you cannot make any turns with this scooter. IfYou lean your weight to the side you can get a very slight shift to the left/right but if you want to make a turn you will have to lift the front part to adjust the scooter to face the direction you wish to go.

Height of handle can be easily adjusted as well as the height of the seat.  Great gift that grows with the child.', 'Yes', 'I read the description before buying and read about the scooter turning only if you lean a certain way. However, your child has to lean HARD to the point of the scooter almost tipping in order to turn and it’s a very wide turn; you can’t make any sharp turns or turn around completely without picking up the scooter.

It makes delicious fresh coffee and milk based drinks. You will see in my video that I add my favorite creamer before my latte brews. I like mine a little sweet, and that’s what works for me. I have bought some organic syrups and can’t wait to try those, too. It has been so much fun and a delicious experience getting to know my machine.I will try to keep my review list short and simple:Pros:*Makes a delicious coffee beverage (haven’t tried iced coffee yet, but I’m certain it won’t disappoint*Reminds you to clean the milk spout with a touch of a button when finished making your milk based drinks, as you will see in my video*Automatically does a quick rinse of the coffee/water spout when turned on or off, as you will see in my video (always keep a small cup there to catch the water)*Allows to reconfigure settings to your preference and memorizes the settings you chose - I.e. more water, less foam, etc. (you can find videos on how to change settings - super easy)*Has a decent sized water tank that provides multiple drinks before filling up again*VERY easy to learn and start making coffee right out of the box (just be sure to follow initial cleaning steps first)*Accommodates whole beans and ground coffee (be sure to read how to do ground coffee, as the machine is supposed to be on, can’t go over a certain amount at a time, etc. - easy to grasp but I want you to get it right)*Alerts when it’s time to refill water tank or remove coffee grounds from its disposal tank.*Very quick process and well worth the drink - it’s definitely a treat for my husband and me.*Has a hot water feature for teas, oatmeal, etc. You pick how much you need (no preset for that, I don’t think). Just be sure to have the hot water spout attached (original spout that you remove to attach the milk container for milk based drinks)*Very hot temperature, which I love. Just be aware and careful when you first brew and take that first sip. Temperature can be adjusted - just watch a YouTube video or read the manual to learn how.Cons:*Ive only found one, and I could be mistaken. But I don’t recall getting an alert when my beans needed refilled. I am new to ground beans and maybe it expects we know how many we should use. I don’t yet know, so I put enough beans in to cover the base. However, I could tell it was out during one of my drinks because I didn’t hear a strong grind. The drink was not good. Not a big deal, but it’s worth calling out if you’re wondering or like me and a newbie to whole beans. We will get it down!I love this machine, and I am so thankful it was on a deal. We splurged and got it for Christmas for us. My advice - don’t wait another morning without this machine. You deserve this; You won’t be disappointed.', 'I don\\'t write reviews often and wanted to wait about 6 months to see if I still like the Magnifica Eva. So the answer is yes! I shopped various others and at the end opted for this one because it really does make high-level espresso drinks with a \\'one-button\\' approach. So here are some pro\\'s, con\\'s, and highlights:Pros: Very simple to use once you get past the instructions. They do need to improve these. But it does make excellent coffee with minimal care. You just have to follow the descaling instructions every few weeks. We use it multiple times a day and it has not failed at all. Also it doesn\\'t consume much counter space.Cons: Well we have all got used to touchsceens with easy instructions. This is not that machine. Harken back to the 2000\\'s when multi-function buttons were the thing. But once you get used to those, it is very predictable. The water reservoir is a bit on the small side so if you are a big coffee drinker, you will have to fill it daily. Also I haven\\'t used the foaming milk attachments since I really don\\'t want to clean those and a battery whisk is much simpler.Pro-tips: 1) Use espresso roast beans. They just work better. The per-cup cost is very low since the grinder is very efficient. 2) The isn\\'t much useful guidance on the grinding adjustment settings. After much experimentation, I feel that setting the knob to a  \"5\" worked the best for me. 3) Empty the drip tray daily and give it a quick rinse.Overall I am very pleased. While the instructions are a bit archaic, you can can understand them with a bit of effort.', \"We ordered this machine on November  . Was working very well for the first two weeks. Then we got alarm for descalnig. We followed the instructions, and after this process, the machine malfunctions and started flowing a much smaller quantity of any coffee type wechosee.I called the customer service department and spent with them onlin,  about one hour with a camera on to trying to solve the problem and waste a lot of coffee. Finally, in conclusion, they told me the machine have to be replaced with a new one and their department will contact me by email in two to five working days. Because I don't have from them any information after that time I called again and they told me to wait two days more for instructions. Finally, they called me back and informed me that they do not have on the stock the machine for replacement.Fortunately, I purchased this mahine from Amazon, and I have an open window to return through Amazon. Otherwise, you have to wait for a refund from De'longhi five weeks.In conclusion, their Customers Service don't care about you and is the worst service I have ever.Not recommend to anyone.\", \"12 month update: We still absolutely love the De'Longhi Magnifica.  No issues whatsoever.  Guests all rave about how simple the machine is to use, no one needs to clean a portafilter, and drinks taste wonderful.  Price has dropped over the past year, it's totally worth it!3 Month Update: Still loving the De'Longhi Magnifica. Zero issues using it. It’s fast, straightforward, and worth every penny.Here's my coffee journey through many, many years: Mr. Coffee -->mini-espresso-->French Press-->pour over—>Keurig-->Breville-->De'Longhi.I LOVE this De'Longhi Magnifica!  If I had to narrow it down to one reason, it's that I do not have to wash a portafilter each time I make espresso!  Honesty, this is worth every penny.  We make 2-6 espressos or coffee nearly every day and some days I would just skip the drink if I have to wash everything again.Not only does this Magnifica deal with the portafilter for me, I can make a plain cup of coffee, tea, or use other grounds to make any drink.You can make espresso drinks (hot/cold), coffee, tea, froth milk.  So many options in one machine with very little clean up.At first I was a bit overwhelmed with the buttons, but a little practice and it was a cinch!  The espresso taste great and the options are outstanding.One complaint (which is really minor): the water reservoir is small and must be added to often (lack of water can disrupt a pour).  Every night, after my tea, I fill the water reservoir and the beans to be ready for the morning.  I dump the grounds every 3-5 days (the machine will notify you) and wash everything that needs it.When you turn on and off the machine, it will run a quick clean cycle.  Place a small glass or pitcher underneath and then the tray won't fill up as quickly.My first espresso machine was the Breville, which I have loved for years.  I've retired it for this one and I love the Magnifica!*This machine does not come with a milk pitcher.**The first machine we got had an issue with the steam/water.  Anytime we used the steam/water, the machine would freeze for 20-30 minutes!  I requested a replacement and that issue did not come up with our new machine.Review for De'Longhi ECAM29043SB Magnifica Evo Coffee and Espresso Machine, Silver\", \"I've owned a few days over two months. and product delivers hot (not scalding) drinks made to excellent standards. For the best results use the best beans, water, double walled glasses. Truly fully automatic.Not complicated but follow directions carefully. Downsides: not a lot of experimentation allowed. Yes you can program a double  - but it's easier to just drop in a second shot of expresso.. Also, Use coldest & freshest 2% milk (or preferred substitute) in creamer and don't store overnight in creamer supply container. Use best supplies and clean/descale etc on schedule or ahead of schedule. If warning indicator comes on - First check water and bean supply, and be sure creamer/foamer is attached firmly. Great product so far.\", \"Works well but every time it operates it sounds like it's breaking the sound barrier. Very loud...like fighter jet loud.  Also, it doesn't work well with foaming cashew milk (almond and soy are fine), and you cannot make a large latte on one run, you must make two lattes to equate to large.  Otherwise suppose the machine warrants the high price.\", 'I read all the reviews, advice, tutorials, and manuals. I went in prepared with reasonable expectations and was ready to make the adjustments. I was totally blown away. First, I followed the instructions: read all the instructions before unboxing (manual is on the companies website along with a video of a walk through of the process). I had a Saturday morning set aside for set up prepared to make lots of adjustments, so Friday night I unboxed and did my water prime. (Hint- the water filter is a bit tough. I ended up priming without it and coming back to it in the morning. If the filter light won’t stop flashing it’s not o all the way. Also, it flushes a LOT of water after install, empty your basin before doing this step, I overflowed.)Next I set up the espresso settings. Waste at least 3 shot of espresso, then brew a shot to judge BEFORE you make any adjustments to brew strength or grind size. The system needs 3-4 shots to get ready. I didn’t have to make any adjustments. My espresso came out beautiful, just like the picture tasting amazing with a light fruity finish -(Lavazzo espresso Barista Gran Crema whole bean).Last I set up the Lattecrema system. Lots of reviews say it doesn’t make much froth, but all I had in the house was lactose free skim milk and my macchiato had an inch of foam on top.All of my drinks have been piping hot, and even my plain cup of coffee had a head of crema offer brewing.I’m kind of in love with this machine. I’ve named him. I’ve had way too much coffee this morning.I have always wanted a coffee maker like this and it has definitely lived up to the hype!', \"I ordered this machine on December 11th 2022. Up until a few days ago it worked just fine. Now it won't make lattes, espressos, or any coffee whatsoever. The problem started after I hit the descaling button. From that point forward the machine locked. I followed instructions in the manual in an effort to descale the machine even though I had not been alerted by the machine that this was necessary. The machine would not start the descaling process. I tried to reset the machine to factory standards again following instructions in the manual I received with the machine to the letter,but the machine would not do that.I went online to check obtain information I provided when I registered the machine within 14 days of the date I received it. After signing in there was no sign that my machine was ever registered even though I have an email confirming successful registration.While on the Delonghi site I checked to see if I have the right owners manual.The owners manual that came with My machine lists three different model numbers but not mine.My search indicated that the model that I own was no longer being serviced and there was no owners manual to be found. The model number on my Amazon invoice and on the bottom of my machine is ECAM49043SB.I spoke to two service representatives and neither could find my registration but acknowledged that I did register it after I sent them my purchase invoice and email from Deloghi confirming registration.Neither of the reps I spoke with could find my model or its owner manual on the Delonghi web site.I will be calling Delonghi back tomorrow and asking for a new machine and not a refurbished one. If they refuse I'll also be contacting Amazon.I owned this machine's predecessor and used it daily for 10 to 12 years before it died. That's why I decided to buy another one. I guess you can say they don't make them like they used to.Stay tuned. I'll let you know how Delonghi and/or Amazon respond to my warranty request.\", 'I had decided I was tired of going to coffee shops, spending a ton of money and creating more garbage/plastic in the world. I am so grateful I got this machine as I literally do not purchase any coffee outside of my home (unless traveling). I have found my perfect cup for me is 2 x espresso and 1 latte macchiato makes me a perfect cup. And as far as tea goes, it brews a very delicious cup of tea. You can also adjust the water by pressing it a second time (as first time makes about 4 ounces of tea) and when you have your cup filled to your liking, you press the water button again and it will stop the water flow. The temperature of the water is so critical in making an excellent cup of tea, and this machine accomplishes this beautifully. I do wish I had the option to only steam milk to make a London fog latte ( but I also haven’t really done a lot of research to see if I can accomplish this- to be fair).', \"This machine is everything I hoped it would be. It makes delicious drinks quickly at the push of a button and takes care of its own cleaning. My only complaint is that I can't easily change beans. Now that I can make espresso so easily I want to drink it all day but can't switch to decaf without using preground coffee, which doesn't come out nearly as good. I might just make it a decaf machine permanently and get my caffeine some other way!\", 'Really like this machine, 8/10. If you want to taste a craft coffee roasters but wish that the barrista would make it for you - this is a great match. Things to consider:1) READ THE MANUAL - this machine is very sensitive and it needs a person who follows the instructions, especially during the decalc function2) NO GRINDING FLEXIBILITY - if you change the grinder’s setting, it will take at least 4 espressos to adjust to the grinding.3) DON’t EXPECT VERY HIGH PRESSURE - this is a vibratory propulsion system and you can’t experiment with the coffee that is ground super finely', 'Machine works well. The milk frother stopped working but I contacted Support and they identified the problem as well as provided detailed instructions on how to clean the milk frothing system. Additional information on cleaning cycles for the frother would be helpful.', 'With cheap beans output coffee is  absolutely unsaturated,  despite the fact you can make good coffee from cheap beans in dzhezva.  So,  this machine is more or less good only with very high quality coffee beans.', \"Ok, that'll probably sounds like a click-grabber since it's the first that I've actually owned. But it's not the first I've used and it seems on par with much more expensive machines I've frequently used (and drooled over).Set-up was easy and after doing the initial pump-priming I was ready for my first espresso. After the recommended 1st couple of runs I was ready for my first espresso to drink.It took a few tries to get the balance of grind level/coffee strength to where I wanted it (which was expected) but the pulls are pretty consistently where I want them now. My moment of fear was when I chocked it by making the grinds too fine while I had the strength up to max. I calmed down and figured this out after I looked at the troubleshooting to find what the angry little lights meant and dialed back the grind settings and all was fine. Lesson learned: Don't turn the grind setting wheel too much at a time. Baby steps. My expectation is that if I change the type of beans I'm using I'll probably have to tweak it, but again that's expected.Those few times when I want a latte or cappuccino the LatteCrema system is a nice alternative to the more time consuming manual process. I got that option mostly for my wife so she could easily make her own cappuccinos and that alone was worth the price of the option. Fat free milk seems to work best for a thicker foam. Higher fat seems to = bigger bubbles.As others have commented the water container could have been larger. The rinsing cycles will help you go through a lot of water but I appreciate the rinsing to keep all the 'pipes' clean. The LatteCrema system also does it's own rinse cycle which will contribute to the water usage as well. But overall a very small issue and it's easy enough to refill it. Might be nice if they did an 'extended' tank that extends out from the side, but I doubt that we'll see that.Time will tell on durability. I'm sure taking care of the machine correctly will be a factor in that. As in any automatic device they're more complicated with many moving parts. Your typical coffee machine has a lot less break points and moving parts than an automated one. As a result it will be important to follow the maintenance directions to keep it running and in tip-top shape.UPDATE: 3 months in and I'm still very happy with the machine, no issues. I've been cleaning it monthly and it's pretty easy. Been putting a new filter in monthly. Personally I've found I like the medium espresso roasts with an Arabica/Robusta blend. So far we've been using Lavazza beans exclusively because the quality/freshness has been good as has the price point. In three months we've gone thru about 6 KG (13 LB) of beans so I guess we're drinking a fair bit of espresso?\", 'We have been using this machine for almost 3 months now.  I would have purchased a different machine if I had used this previous to purchase.1.  Too much water waste.  The machine flushes when turned on and when it shuts off.  There is no way to just leave it on.  The longest is 3 hours.  If you want coffee throughout the day, you may end up turning it on again and it will flush the system again.2.  It does not let you know when the water is low.  It will make you a partial cup if it is near time to fill.  It wastes beans because of this.3. It does not let you know when beans need added.  It again, will make you a cup of water when the beans are low.4.  We have tried to use the grounds feature and the coffee just slides down into the waste tray.  It does not work.5.  The milk frother stopped frothing the milk after the first week.  It warms it, but does not froth it.We add water to this machine a lot because of the flushing.  It is NOT worth the money charged.  We like the coffee it makes, but with all the other issues I would not recommend this machine.', \"The De'Longhi Magnifica Evo is an all-in-one brewing station that aims to bring coffee shop style drinks to your kitchen at a more affordable price than many of its competitors. My favorite feature of this machine is the milk container. It's designed with convenience in mind. You can fill the container at any time and even leave it in your fridge. When you're ready to make drinks, just attach it to the machine. After making drinks, the De'Longhi will prompt you to run a clean cycle, which you can do with milk still in the container! The wand is steam cleaned and never touches the milk inside. Then you can disconnect the container and put it back in the fridge. No wasted milk! The only downside is that making a large basic cup of coffee isn't as easy as the other drinks because of the way the machine is designed to make espresso type drinks. One is limited to a smaller cup of regular coffee, so it's not ideal for filling a travel mug on your way out the door. However, all things considered, this machine does all the drinks listed in the menu system very well, including the smaller cup of coffee. Another thing to note is that although it mentions iced coffee, it still brews the coffee hot, and you add it over your own ice. Other machines can make colder brews, but this isn't one of them. Another feature I appreciate is the simplicity. It's a one-button push system, with no profiles for different drinks. They even added a hot water option for tea. This is a big plus for tea drinkers like me who enjoy a strong cup of black tea. The machine makes the water hot enough to brew tea nicely. Most all-in-one systems don't bother with tea, so it's great that they included it. Overall, it's an outstanding machine that will appeal to coffee drinkers who want coffee shop style drinks with simplicity in making them. I was really impressed by how professional this machine made my drinks. I am happy to save money instead of going to the coffee shop every morning.\", \"I did a lot of research and waited for the price deals on Amazon before buying this machine last November. We have been using it ever since and are very pleased with the performance, flexibility and quality of the espressos, cappuccinos and coffees that it makes.It is very quick to cycle up and produces hot water, about 10-15 seconds, and the whole grind to espresso process takes less than a minute. It is also a lot quiter than I anticipated. We have a cat who doesn't like loud noises and this has never bothered him.I have also tried making coffee using pre-ground beans and while it works, it doesn't taste as good. It is pretty much the same taste as making it in an automatic drip coffee machine.There are only two minor things I wish were better. First, it doesn't take long for the coffee pucks to trigger the sensor that you need to empty the bin. I have seen this happen after only 4-5 uses. The bin isn't full at all, it just requires you to push the pucks down.Second, while the tray under the machine slides out easily for cleaning, there is always a little bit of coffee grounds at the very back of the tray that can fall out as you remove the tray. This is really more of an annoyance than anything.Beyond that, I would highly recommend this espresso machine to anyone.\", 'This the second Delonghi cappuccino machines i have owned.  Delonghi makes a good product.  This new improved version is easier to use and the coffee it produces is not bitter, and it steams the milk more efficiently.  If you like a quality latte or cappuccino this is the home machine to buy.', \"The De'Longhi Magnifica Evo™ with the LatteCrema system is easy to work. The packaging is really secure and they have package it really well. Next was getting all the tape off and washing the different removable parts with warm water and a mild detergent. Finally, it was time to make some magic happen. We plugged it in and got it primed, that step is simple to do. Next, we added our beans and the LatteCrema system and made a wonderful cappuccino. It was a bit noisy at every step of the process from grinding to brewing, but so worth it for the drinks that it produces! Overall, it worked wonderfully and made very delicious drinks. It has a rinse feature to help clean out the extra milk from the LatteCrema system, such an added bonus. Once done brewing it disposes of the coffee grounds in a little bin, you take the bin a dump the grounds and away you go! The machine came with a water hardness tester, water filter, and some descaler. Very impressive machine! I highly recommend this for anyone wanting speciality drinks at home it can just do hot water too.\", 'Prompt delivery.  Excellent coffee maker.  Easy to use.', 'The coffee that comes out of this machine is straight up amazing. It looks, smells, and tastes like I\\'m getting it from a gourmet restaurant. I\\'ve tried one cappuccino so far and that was delicious as well. It took me and my wife a few minutes of playing with it to figure out the buttons and I guess the system needed a cycle or two to start working seamlessly but since we figured it out, it\\'s been amazing. If you can afford it and appreciate a fantastic cup of coffee or cappuccino, I fully endorse it. My wife has used the tea setting (it heats water very quickly) and we\\'ll keep exploring with the other types of drinks.You can use either whole ground beans, just be careful that you put the right type of bean in the right spot (they don\\'t go in the same place). Water level is easy to check, the nozzle adjusts so you can control how foamy you like your coffee (I keep it at the \"most foam\" level because it\\'s perfect), and cleaning isn\\'t difficult but you do want to make sure you understand what parts come off for routine cleaning - for instance, after using milk for cappuccino, you have to clean the milk reservoir and tubes to avoid ganky milk nastiness. It\\'s normal and it\\'s easy, you just have to be deliberate and do it. Also, the machine will run a little water through the pipes to keep them clean and while it has a drip pan to catch that sort of thing, I recommend keeping a cup under the spout for simplicity.', 'This appliance is great after you go through literally several rounds of qualifying adjustments. Once you make an adjustment it takes a few rounds for equipment to adjust and there were times it has red lights turning on many times thinking you got a defect. Be patient. It took about 30-40 mins to go through adjustments tweaking and then equipment qualification runs before you got the best tasting coffee. The coffee crema for espresso was fabulous.Here are some notes to consider like others pointed out:1) do not miss the priming for the very first time. Does take about half of the water tank and it does take about 15 mins.  When you turn the steamer dial I turned it until it clicked and nothing happened. Just turn it to the left but don’t turn it as far as the click. Hot water will stream out for a long time making you think this is wrong. It is not. It’s priming the appliance to go through parts of the appliance for the first time.2) adjusting the coarse or fine for grinder is on the daisy wheel inside the grinder. Keep in mind when it’s grinding that’s when you adjust. Then run it twice for the appliance to register new settings. Really follow the page 9 direction on what it should look like flowing like honey.3) turning off the appliance sets it into auto cleaning so keep a mug underneath for water to spit out after a cleaning cycle.Once you got the adjustments there’s nothing like freshly ground coffee brewing. The crema was great and we used lavazza coffee super crema beans as well as Lilly brands. Of course we used almost half of the bag just adjusting and getting used to the controls. I was getting impatient but finally the appliance went through its steps and now works flawlessly.It’s Italian engineering and is UL listed. So the way Europe establishes controls are different than what is Americans are exposed to. But it is a very sophisticated system with learning capability.', 'Makes great coffee the best part of this machines if you use the milk option it cleans the system after every use before you put in fridge to me thats one of the biggest thing that separates this machine from others. I wish you could fine the coffee a bit more though I understand it could strain the brewer and even clog it but it’s a tad bit finer this would be one of the best machines out. This coming from someone owed Lavazza blue, Phillips, bean to cup, and a rancillioOne love', 'Best coffee machine that I have ever owned. If you are a coffee lover, you will definitely appreciate this machine.', 'Very expensive', 'Love this coffee machine so much. Simplifies morning coffee routine.Pros:- built in coffee bean grinder- touch screen- customizable recipes/coffee strength- easy to clean- coffee tastes greatCons:- on the larger size but if you have the counter space it is so worth it.', \"Where to start?  There are so many good things about the DeLonghi Magnifica Evo coffee maker.  This is a sleek looking machine that I am happy to have on my kitchen counter.  It is super easy to use and is intuitive.  It offers a large water reservoir, cutting down on the number of times one has to refill.  The Magnifica Evo can be used with either whole beans or ground coffee, making it one of the most versatile coffee makers on the market.  the adjustable brew head can accommodate a variety of large or small cups, making it easy to pull a single shot of espresso, or a larger mug of coffee.  It also holds a considerable amount of beans, and is quiet when grinding.  This machine also does a pre and post rinse of the brew head, making sure it's clean and free of any residue.  This feature ensures a fresh cup with every pull.  The Evo has a LatteCrema system which consists of a milk container and frother.  One can add dairy or plan based milk, and make a latte or cappuccino with a single touch.  Again, the milk container is easy to use, and can be popped out of the machine and placed in the refrigerator if there is milk left over.  There is also a self cleaning function that shoots hot water through the spout, ensuring there is no milk left in the spout to turn sour.  The brewing cycle is short, there is pretty much no wait time.  One of the best features, it truly is a one-touch system, offering a number of different drinks in an instant.  The coffee drinks are smooth and creamy, brewing a really mellow cup without any bitter or acidic notes.  The Magnifica Evo is a keeper, a sleek machine that makes a great tasting coffee of my choice, all at the push of a button.\", 'Using it for a month or so , it’s working great. I wish it had some kind of steam more so that I can make my coffee little hot than it heats for my taste', \"I acquired the coffee machine since few days ago. It has been a literal Game Changer in my morning routine. Previously I had a manual coffee machine from De'longhi. It was tedious but it almost always made a consistently good coffee. Every morning I would take 10 min to do my coffee. Between grinding the beans, warming and frotting the milk, and letting the machine goes to temperature, it was a whole process I started to resent once I also had to take care of a little human being. Now, I start the machine, let it clean itself, plug in the LatteCrema System, and it does its magic! The only thing I regret is not buying it sooner. I tried to do some Ube Latte, and some Almond and Hazelnut milk latte, and it works consistently great with alternative milk or flavored milk. It is a great upgrade for anyone who loves good fresh ground bean coffee without the struggle of making it! Concerning the setup, it took me a good 30 min as you also have to set up the machine depending on the hardness of the water. but the rest was pretty straightforward. So far, I have no complaints and I am utterly satisfied with my new machine.Little note: As it has an automatic cleaning system, you will need a small recipient on the side to catch the water when you start and turn off the machine and when you clean the steam wand for the LatteCrema system. You also have to change some settings if you change the type of beans you are using. You can also use espresso ground coffee using the spoon provided for measurement, but nothing else beats fresh ground coffee though.\", \"As mentioned in the title I really like the De'Longhi Magnifica Evo. The coffee machine is easy to use and almost makes you feel like a barista at home. With all the pre-programmed coffees the machine is easy to use and requires no complicated setup before usage. Even the 'simpler option', making hot water for a tea, is really nice to use as before this machine we always heated some water in a pan.Additionally I also really like how easy it is to clean the machine, whereas with other machines this can be a hassle the Magnifica Evo has a built in program that requires minimal manual work. Same goes for the separate milk tank, when you are not using milk for your Latte's you easily detach the separate milk tank and store it in your fridge.The only 'issue' I had with the coffee machine was the setup of the water reservoir, which comes with a cleaning bottle that needs to be filled with water separately and then be attached in the exact right way to not get an error on the machine. However, after watching a video on YT this problem was quickly solved.Overall me and my family are really enjoying this coffee machine and it is a joy to make coffee every morning!\", \"Sprung for this as an upgrade to my Delonghi Magnifica I've had for like 5 years or so, when Amazon had a $300 price drop around Christmas. The old machine is still working perfectly. The main upgrade is the automatic frother. I found the seemingly slight nuisance of manual frothing resulted in me only rarely making a latte or cappucino. With the automatic frother it's a lot easier, just fill the little container, press the button and done. Froth is perfect every time so far. Afterward just put the container in the fridge for the next time, top it off when needed. There's a clean button to hit after making a milk drink, it just pumps a little hot water through the system to flush out the milk, just takes a few seconds. The container comes apart into 3 pieces that can go in the dishwasher, though I haven't done that yet.\", 'It makes good coffee but I wish it would come out a little faster . I am used to faster delivery', 'The media could not be loaded.I have always wanted to be able to make a coffee shop quality drink without the coffee shop price. This De’Longhi Magnifica Evo LatteCrema System does just that. I can make my favorite coffee shop drinks from the comfort of my home. The whole coffee maker is beautifully designed, it is an eye catching centerpiece to the kitchen now! The water tank and the coffee catcher on the insides are hidden but also easy to remove for filling and cleaning. The machine is easy to use but takes a little setting up and cleaning prior to the first use. You can easily switch from the milk frother spout to the hot water spout depending on your drink of choice. I really love having a clean spout for hot water to easily switch between tea and coffee. The milk frother works really well with my dairy free milks as well! This machine creates the freshest coffee you could imagine! Freshly grinds your beans immediately before use, this gives a deliciously nutty flavor to any cup of coffee! You can even adjust how course or fine you grind your beans. The milk container has the levels of milk necessary for all of your favorite coffee beverages. From a simple shot of espresso to a latte to a stronger over ice brew you will never need the coffee shop again! The machine is easy to clean and the instructions are thorough and easy to follow. I can’t imagine being happier with a coffee maker; I couldn’t have imagined that I could make a cup of coffee this delicious! Now on to practicing my latte art! De’Longhi out did themself with this coffee maker! I highly recommend it!', 'I just got this yesterday, took 20 min read the instructions. Followed the easy cleaning steps with pictures lol. I’ve made 9 different coffees so far. My family all love it, my daughter said the coffee house down the street has just been replaced! So good, fresh and just the way I want it with no expensive disappointments! Girls you know, as soon as you see your barista hand you your coffee you can tell if it’s right by the color and dang it when you know it’s wrong because you just paid $7+ for something you’ll choke down or trash, right? Well no more! This right here is stopping all of that! I read comments on here, it does clean before and after, I just keep a coffee cup near it, put it under the spout when I start it and but it back under when I’m done and boom! trust me, I’m happy that it does it. I don’t want to take it apart after every coffee! Super excited about this machine! Glad I finally just said no more to disappointing coffee! Can’t wait to see what I create tomorrow! Need to learn coffee art lol', 'Machine works great. Not as loud as some reviews I read have stated, normal super automatic coffee machine noise level. Coffee tastes great, lots of different functions.', \"I went through the quick-start instructions in the booklet when I unboxed the beautiful De'Longhi today. It was so easy to get from box to full-on coffee shop, I was making my first cappuccino in minutes. It was gorgeous and delicious. The foam was light and silky and lasted through to the last drop. I used a clear glass mug that you can see in my picture. I mean, it's about flavor and savor, but it also is just so pretty to look at with all that foam. The machine is elegant and streamlined, so it looks great and doesn't take up a lot of counter space. In fact, my husband and I are discussing how many of our old coffee makers this one replaces! It does so many things.  We don't need our tea kettle. We don't need our futzy little espresso maker that took forever to produce a cup of coffee and the foam had to be produced separately while our coffee got cold. I can't get over that I can wake up in the morning tomorrow and push the picture of the coffee drink I want and have a truly European and delicious start to my day. Just wow.\", 'As someone who starts their day with a cup of coffee I absolutely love this machine! The set up was quick and the quick start up guide was easy to read and digest, the machine is VERY easy to use right away. Aesthetically, the machine is compact and very modern in look and functionality. Now onto the reason why are all here - the brew. I use whole beans and was able to fit a standard bag of coffee in the chamber. You can adjust the coarseness of your grounds for those that enjoy the whole bean experience. There is also a spout to put in pre-ground coffee if that is your preference The Magnifica has several preset options so one press of a button and you get a delicious creamy espresso. The adjustable spout is a great touch and let me make both a cup of regular joe and a gorgeous single shot of espresso. There is also the option to steam milk or run hot water for standalone drinks. I actually used the milk steamer for my oat milk cappuccino and it worked great adding a nice velvet texture. All in all I highly recommend this machine for those that want to a quick and easy cup of delicious coffee as well as those who want to have more choices for their morning beverage.', \"I've absolutely loved using our new De'Longhi Magnifica Evo coffee machine. This thing is so fast, easy to use, and makes an excellent cup of coffee. We got this machine to replace another whole bean machine, and the Evo blows it out of the water. All you need to do is add beans, water, and milk, and the machine takes care of the rest. We love that there is no need to pack the grinds for an espresso, which seriously sped up our morning routine without any loss of flavour or creaminess. My husband was just saying that we can never go back to packing our own grinds because the Evo is just so much faster.I also love that the machine makes everything fro mixed coffee to cappuccinos, and all in a sleek, modern-looking machine that has a slimmer profile than our last one, which looks great in our kitchen and saves us precious counter space.I also appreciate that there is a large cavity for beans, so we don't have to refill the machine as often. But I also really like that there's a port for pre-ground coffee, which enables us to make regular and decaf coffee without switching out the beans. Overall, I have been so impressed with this powerful, versatile machine and I can't recommend it enough.\", 'Love this unit use it multiple times a day. The milk foam container stopped working within the month. It was washed everyday by hand. Seemed to pour milk but no more foam.', 'We purchased our first Magnifica espresso machine in December 2019. We have a large family, so the machine is well used. It is easy to use and saves us so much money on buying coffee and coffee shops! Our first machine gave up the ghost about 2 weeks ago. We immediately did research and once again purchased this machine. You will love it! Very easy to use and clean.', 'I went to Italy and our Friends owned 1 older brand by DeLongi / Expresso Machine.  Every morning they made me a cup of Capucchino.  Then we stayed with another friends of ours in California and they too owned an older DeLongi Expresso Machine.  I was hooked.  My research paid off.  The reviews were 4-5 Stars.  I got one for $499.00 on sale during Black Friday Sales.My husband kept asking “Did you find one yet you like?”.I have and enjoying it every day. I have saved money already, making my own from home instead of buying it from a fancy bakery or cafe.  Learning how to function all the buttons takes patience.  I am thrilled with my “DeLongi Magnifica Evo”.  A gift to myself.  My first Expresso Machine.  Insuring it is always a good idea.', 'Love the coffee and the options. That\\'s why we bought it.Not so impressed with the frequency of \"descaling\"  and customer service was terrible! I bought it in early December. My husband opened it Christmas morning. January 15 the I reached out to customer service because the milk carafe had a crack. I was told it\\'s more than 30 days old too bad. Not impressed.', \"When I visit my sister, who lives out of state, she always makes me a cappuccino in the morning. She has a manual espresso machine and frother. The quality of the cup this De'Longhi machine makes is equal to or better than the manual machine's result. Recently, we were visiting friends in Portugal and they had this machine and made us coffee with it every morning. We fell in love with it and decided to buy one when we got home. We love the variety of choices you have. One of our favorite options this machine has is the separate hopper for a measured amount of already ground coffee. This is great for making a cup of decaf espresso at night. The frothed milk is always perfect and it's self-cleaning process is great! Buy it! You'll love it!\", 'Wow, what a difference I\\'m actually drinking coffee now, didn\\'t know what I was missing. The De\"Longhi Magnifica Evo is very easy to operate. Just start with the coffee beans which you can grind to your like then you are off and running. I made regular coffee first and can\\'t wait to experiment with all the possibilities. I\\'ll keep you posted as I do. Now I know the difference between a latte and a cappuccino before then I thought coffee was coffee! The one-touch My Latte feature is my go-to button! I was a little intimidated and hesitant after reading the instructions but once I got started it was simple your like Oh, okay! I was asked a question about long coffee, so I made some wow what a kick!, I\\'ll stick to my latte. The De\\'Longhi Magnifica Evo is very easy to clean so don\\'t worry about bean build-up, just pull open the front drawer and dump! Like I said I was just drinking coffee now I drinking COFFEE, lattes, cappuccinos, whatever my heart desires! The more I use the machine the more I like it!', 'My first impression with this machine is that it is easy to get started! I literally went from unboxing to a finished latte within 10 minutes. Reading the directions is important to know everything available but you can also be a success with just a push of any button.I’ve tried every option of drink and all have so much flavor and the milk foam is perfect. I use dark roast whole beans and half & half milk which I think produces the exact latte I’m looking for with such little effort! One thing to be mindful of is that my usual tall on-the-go coffee cup does not fit under the spout. I remedy this by making it in a shorter cup and pouring it in to my larger one if I need to leave.Cleaning the machine and getting ready for the next day is as easy as a touch of a button!', \"Bought this machine to replace a Saeco Incanto (without auto-milk) that recently died.  My number one concern was milk/froth temperature. I used to have to heat milk in the microwave first before frothing with the Incanto otherwise I had to steam it for minutes to get the milk to not be cold/lukewarm.  Not on this machine.  The frothed milk from the LatteCrema system was sufficiently hot for me even when the milk came directly from the fridge.Pros1. Very easy to use. My wife no longer needs to hunt me down every morning to make her a cup of latte.2. Frothed milk was hot and not lukewarm.3. Easier to clean than the Saeco Incanto.Cons1. No LED screen that can display text. Thus, the manual is required for almost all adjustments/settings.2. Cannot adjust the air/bubbliness in froth.3. No button for just frothed milk.4. The grinder could grind finer to extract more crema.Update 3/3/23: I found a trick to do frothed milk only. Press the button combination to make a latte with pre-ground coffee but don't put any coffee in the chute. The machine will make frothed milk first and then it will sense that there is no coffee in the chute and the run will be cancelled.\", 'The machine is very easy to set up. The instructions are easy to understand and follow, so I had no issues during set up. The water tank is located on the side and pulls out conveniently the front and you can add an optional water filter to it. You have an option of using whole or ground coffee beans. Once I finished setting it up, I thoroughly tested and tasted each type of preprogrammed coffee drinks and it came out perfect each time. The only issue is it’s a bit too noisy when grinding the coffee but at least it’s a fresh cup of coffee each time and you can adjust the temperature and coarseness of the beans to your likeness. All parts of the machine are easy to take apart and wash. If you want professional barista quality coffee drinks at home this machine is a worthy purchase!', 'Doesn’t take as much counter space as my old Delonghi Magnifica, but doesn’t seem as sturdy.  I like where the grinder is housed. I have to use the steam vent twice to make latte. The instructions are horrible. It took us hours to figure out how to descale. Hope we did it correctly. Also, didn’t come with the water filter that it said was enclosed. I wonder if we got one that was returned. Next time I will buy directly from Delonghi!', \"I bought this product after seeing it online as one of the best super automatic machines. It works very well—easy to use, amazing taste.

This machine is a beauty. The instructions to put her together properly were pretty easy, and everything you need (aside from espresso beans and milk), is included. From box to espresso, it probably took me 20 minutes. I LOVE that you can make coffee or espresso drinks, or you can utilize this machine as a hot water source (I’m looking at you, tea). It’s fabulous. Since setting it up yesterday, my husband and I have had at least 6 cups of coffee. It’s absolutely splendid. If you want an easy way to enjoy barista level espresso and coffee, please do yourself a favor and buy this beauty. You will not regret it!', 'It makes great coffee.  If you have a staff to deal with it, buy one.- When first the power button is hit it cycles water through it.  Smart to have a mug ready to catch that water as it comes out the spout.- Randomly long after it\\'s done making the coffee it cycles water through it.  Yes, it looks totally off but then turns itself on, runs water through it, etc.  Smart to have that same mug ready to catch that water.- The grounds are deposited in two piles.  Whole bean \"patties\" are in the bin and easy to remove.  Pre-ground sit in the back of the \"drawer\" that has the discarded water in it (from the first two comments here).  Good luck emptying the water without getting grounds everywhere OR good luck throwing away the grounds without getting water everywhere.This was poorly designed.

It wasn't until one of my technicians found out that the low water sensor was not installed correctly. (We would never get a low water caution light when the hopper was out of water). We removed the side panel and found the low water sensor not secured with a fastener.

It's so easy to operate, too, and the pictures on the machine are fabulous as a reference and for guests to use. After an initial 4 espresso runs, which you're instructed to dump (much less than other espresso machines I've dealt with), the machine is primed and ready to go. Each coffee and espresso drink is ground to order (though you can use preground coffee, too), and even your milk will be steamed and frothed.

The appearance of this coffee machine can overwhelm, but when you take a step back and evaluate the machine with the instructions it becomes 2nd nature to making a good cup of coffee.

Evo has a built in grinder, one touch selections and zero waste. You can make coffee, latte, cappuccino and iced coffee in your home in a matter of minutes. The machine is easy to set up and after a few uses you will be your own barista. Large water reservoir to last all day. No more runs to a coffee shop you have it all your fingertips. Clean up is fairly easy and many videos available to help you as well.\", 'I bought his for myself as a Christmas present and am so happy I finally did. There is a bit of a learning curve to using it but once you figure it out, the coffee is perfect.', 'This espresso machine makes delicious coffee, lattes, macchiatos and pretty much anything else you might want. we chose this model because we did not want to have to hand pack and then clean the espresso grindings as we would with the Breville. This grinds the beans and makes the coffee for you without much work, which was our goal. The output from your espresso machine is directly related to the quantity of the beans you put into it in the first place. so use nice beans and you will get coffee from this. Easy to set up and get going – we are really pleased with it.', 'I bought this last year December and waited a year to review just in case. These actually works well and easy to clean. However I find it weird that I have to constantly also wipe the inside bottom of the machine as it will have coffee grind mess on certain occasion. Just need to constantly adjust coffee strength and grinding modes between different brand of coffee beans. Hope this last a very long time.', 'The top section and the bottom section did not line up - it may be difficult to see from the photo, but it was not attached properly in the manufacturing process.  For this amount of money, the machine should have been perfect upon unpacking, this is a quality control issue.  Amazon would not replace with the same unit, apparently they have had multiple complaints of the same nature per customer service.  Sent it back and ordered the Phillips 3200 instead, we are happy with that selection.', \"Assembled the espresso machine, only to find that the water filter is missing from the box. Very frustrating as I very much want to make a coffee tomorrow morning. Curious as to why it's missing, is this machine an open box purchase?\", \"Overall, when maintained correctly (there are actually five separate parts to the milk frother which each need to be removed and cleaned separately which is not at all clear until you dig through the manual) the Magnifica Evo produces a decent cup of coffee.The controls, however, are quite frustrating to use - to get anything above luke-warm coffee you need to go into several layers of lite led combinations - all of which are a pain.  The most annoying 'feature' is that in order to perform a regular few second milk cleaning you press one button for a couple of seconds - however if you press exactly the same button for just a little longer the machine goes into 'descaling mode' which takes a minimum of 45 minutes to complete and is absolutely impossible to cancel - including unplugging the machine - even if you had performed that task just the previous day.Owning this machine is like owning a car where you press a button for a couple of seconds and it gives you the tire pressure or oil level but holding any longer turns on the check engine light which can't be turned off until you take it in for servicing.  For 'ease of use' I'd give this machine a 1/5 and for the actual coffee product (after spending your time running unnecessary and uncancelable maintenance routines) probably a 3.5/5.0.\", 'Like having an expresso shop in your own home.  Only negative thing I have to say is when you use the ground coffee feature it only says you can put one scoop of ground coffee. The coffee tastes a little on the weak side when you using ground coffee. But otherwise great machine', 'The media could not be loaded.I have been wanting to try out this coffee machine for a while and am glad I got to do so. The fact it makes more than a regular cup of coffee is what first drew me in. It has all the options I could possibly need because sometimes I want something tastier like a latte. It being able to save my favorite recipes is a huge plus. The removable milk frother is very helpful for storing in the fridge until required further. I also appreciate how nice it looks with the black and silver. It’s good quality. I personally recommend.Directions to set everything up is straightforward. Not too hard.', 'We have owned to DeLonghi Magnificas for the last 14 years and have always been pleased with performance and longevity. We thought we had some of the best coffee around. Then unfortunately her last machine stopped working, and we didn’t want to waste the time or money to repair it. So we bought this new generation Magnifica. Holy moly, we are unprepared for how good this coffee would be. Both the coffee and long espresso drinks, the only ones I’ve tried so far have been magnificent, dare I say better than the coffee we drink in Europe. The crema that comes out his rich and delicious. Thank you Delonghi for making another fabulous machine!', \"I worked for a distributor of institutional espresso machines for 8 years and know a couple of things about them. This machine gives professional results everytime. When set up properly, our shots are timed correctly and provided with a rich crema. The beans grinder and tamper are located internally and I get the perfect grind every time. It's easy to pick what type of coffee drink you like, but you will need to adjust the grind size for each type of drink. Also, you will have to steam your milk yourself. Find a good you tube video to show you how if you have never done it before so you can have the very best cup of coffee.\", 'This was a xmas gift and in the six weeks after xmas it has only worked intermittently for two weeks. I pops alarms that require you to \"contact customer service\". The customer service is sorely lacking. They respond as effectively as their defective device. When the machine works, the drinks are enjoyable but you cannot count on the machine to deliver anything. This is a frustrating experience,', 'Got this machine a few weeks ago. It took me 3-4 failed espresso to find the right grind setting (and you also need to have the right coffee for your own taste...), but once this was done, the result was excellent and it makes fantastic espresso. Only reason I did not gave 5 stars is because the machine is actually really loud when it is pumping water or grinding beans.', 'Ordered as a gift for my parents, they love it. Pulls good shots for a super auto machine. Instructions could be better, but it is user friendly. Got it on sale for $500 and it is well worth that.', \"Let me preface by saying that I am not a coffee affectionado but enjoy a good cup of espresso. I have mostly been drinking coffee made by a Nespresso machine and espresso drinks prepared at coffee shops. This was supposed to function as my quick morning espresso that is better that what the Nespresso pods taste like. However, it seems that it is anything but easy. I tried all the grinder settings, using different kinds of beans but couldn't get it to produce a consistent cup. Using the same beans, sometimes the cup is two watered, and sometimes it was too extracted. I ended up getting a semi-automatic espresso machine. The latter requires more work but once dialed in produces a consistent cup.\", 'So this is situationCoffe machine is great only so bad thing is milk frother.I sent this unit to the service because of the milk frother and same thing over and over.It is not worth to buy this together better buy without and buy separately milk frother.And I bought together because I love good milk froth in my coffe.', 'My only reason I did not give it a 5 is because, it’s so annoying that every time the machine turns on or off it spills out water. We have to always have a small cup to catch the water.  so much waist.', 'This was my third attempt at ordering an automated espresso machine. I was determined to like one because I’m sick of paying $$$ for nespresso pods.This machine was definitely the best out of the ones I tried. This one was quieter than the others, easier to use, quicker, and seems better built. This also had a slightly smaller footprint than the others.I will agree with others that the instructions were well written, watch a YouTube video instead.This was comparing apples to apples with competitors’ similar machines, obviously you cannot compare to a robustness of a manual machine or the simplicity of a nespresso/pod type machine.I’m very happy with this machine and have enjoyed my morning coffee more than those darn pods! I hope it passes the rest of longevity now.', 'I loved it and easy to use and the cleaning system is very easy going. Im so happy I made this investment as now as well I will save a lot of money - with this automatic coffee machine having a great experience at home.', \"I had a Jura which was becoming erratic after many years of service - it would turn off - literally just fade out - and couldn't track down the problem. I wanted a new machine at a reasonable price for the daily coffee needs - mostly simple, long, decent freshly ground coffee.Many options were twice the price but I'd be paying for features I don't need.This has plenty of options for various cup sizes and strengths and is an excellent balance of price and function, not bloated with features that will never get used.\", 'Really like this machine. Easy to use once you understand how it works. Some of the operating instructions could be better but some trial and error gets you there', 'Received this item. Took it out and set it up as directed by documentation. Unit would not prime with water and therefore would not operate at all. Got tech support on the phone from the company who was nice and helpful, but after troubleshooting with the manufacturer they said to box it up and return.My only real complaint is the return as I understand that there will be manufacturing issues from time to time. But I returned the machine the next day and the process did not allow an exchange. Only option was to troubleshoot or get my money back. I just wanted to exchange and get a new one ASAP but don’t want to be out another $700+ for another 5-weeks until I get reimbursed for the first one.', \"Not cheap but makes the best coffee I've ever had.  I'm officially spoiled.\", 'Easy to put together and use.  My son and grandson love it.  It takes little space and looks nice on cabinet countertop.', 'Don\\'t expect to be thrilled with this product once you are through the honeymoon phase. The novelty of an automatically made latte wears off as you realize the quality of the drink doesn\\'t measure up to the price tag. I\\'ve adjusted the grind level as instructed in the manual, but haven\\'t been able to get a drink that isn\\'t thin and watered down even when selecting the largest bean amount. It ends up going through beans quite quickly.Without a touch screen, it\\'s quite difficult to navigate the various options in the user interface without having the manual in front of you while you do it. Most are hidden under a layer of \"press and hold button x for 5 seconds until led y starts flashing, then push button z.\" Some of the more complicated operations (like descaling) are quite involved.Overall, I didn\\'t feel like this provided the value of the price tag.', 'Best ever have! Great product easy to use and cleanBeat deal with discount', \"The manuals, like most these days, are primarily picture books that suggest the way things work. When you go to the intermet for clarification you only reduce the clarity. Finally I just dove in and experimented. The X2 button followed by the espresso button yields a double shot of espresso, as I had hoped. Every oher super automatic I've had required two single shots to get the job done.\", 'Loving our magnifica evo. Easy to use and most importantly, easy to clean.', \"You don't know what you don't know.....and I didn't know that there is a BIG difference between drip coffee and coffee made under pressure. The flavor is so much richer and flavorful.  I love love love this coffee maker.  I use Real Good Coffee Company Whole Beans Medium Roast and together with this Delonghi, it is a dream cup of coffee.  Has the crema on top, is very hot and has a great depth of flavor.  Holds a good amount of water and beans.  Machine is user friendly and nice to look at too!  Very happy with this purchase.\", 'Love this machine.  I have DeLonghi Magnifica but wanted the added feature of automated latte or macchiato and I have not been disappointed.  Set up was easy and the espresso is near barista quality from the comfort of home.  I only use whole bean and factory preset grind works well with a nice crema.  Assuming the Evo will be as reliable as my old Magnifica we will have years of great coffee drinks.  Challenge now is limiting my consumption of lattes.', \"Good machine for the price and very easy to use. This one is for my condo down south. I have the De'Longi Dinamica back home and that one is a better unit. Nothing bad to say about either machine but the Dinamica brews a slightly better cup and a few better options. You can't go wrong with either.\", 'Really like this one so far. Hope it stands the test if time.', 'I finally took the dive and decided on this Espresso machine.After it first arrived, my wife turned into a Barista for my whole family, and was mixing up all kinds of different Americanos, Cappuccinos, Lattes, Ice Coffees, you name it!  ALL of them were delicious!We still use this every day, sometimes multiple times a day.One thing to note if you plan on purchasing, consider buying the Descaling Solution, and also the correct filter to pair with it.', 'We love everything about this coffeemaker.

       "   'When the pull-out handle stopped working on my dinosaur fabric carry-on during a recent trip to Belize, I finally realized it was time to replace it. Samsonite has always deserved the brand awareness it has earned as being a top brand in luggage. My parents always used it. Our old Samsonite hard shelled luggage never failed after years of car trips all throughout the west.This was the main reason I chose this brand. I’ve now have had 4 trips on it, and it has lived up to its reputation. The luggage is very light, yet the Polycarbonate shell is very tough. It doesn’t deform after being tossed around and really doesn’t show scratches. Best Features:• The mesh and elastic straps keep things neatly in place.• The expandable feature lets you add a lot more stuff (while still fitting in the overhead bin).• The wheels are very well made and roll smoothly over bumps, carpet, escalator ribs and up ramps.• The TSA locks are designed very smartly.• Zippers are STRONG.• The Caribbean Blue looks really cool and totally stands out. You can’t miss it in the luggage carousel.• Well worth spending the extra bucks on something that will last a long time.• I rate this a definite BUY!',\n",
       "   \"Samsonite Omni PC Hardside Spinner 20, Caribbean Blue, One SizeMy last carry on suitcase served me well for over 12 years, accompanying me on countless trips, usually over-stuffed, through winter weather, through slush and rain and dragged across the cobble-stone streets in Berlin. In the last couple years it began to show it's age, but it wasn't until the handle finally ripped off and the inner lining tore a small hole on my most recent trip that I admitted it was finally time to move on.My initial inclination was to buy something cheap - I don't need fancy luggage, I got student loans to pay... So I was poking around and looking at options in the $30 - $40 market, and there were some that looked ok. But then I would dig into the reviews and read about them breaking on the first trip, or having stuck wheels or finicky handles... Not feeling satisfied I put off the purchase for a while. I went to a store and looked at some of these models in person, and I was startled by how flimsy they felt in person. They were not built to handle the abuse of transatlantic air-travel. Feeling ambivalent, I put off the decision yet again.Fast forward to Tuesday of this week, no suitcase purchased, my flight is Friday morning. I pull my old trusty carry-on out of storage and seriously debate taking it on one last journey... just one more time?? The suitcase does not want. So I come back to Amazon and search again until I find this suitcase. It's not super cheap, but it's not expensive either, and it has a great color, and good reviews, and it sturdy in the photos... I'm still undecided, but, well, clock is ticking, I bite the bullet.Suitcase arrived just in time for my flight :-) My roommate carried the box upstairs for me this afternoon and when I thanked her, commented on how light it was. As soon as I open it I am relieved, this is a strong and sturdy suitcase, and it looks smart. The handle is long, and slides out easily, doesn't rattle around like those other flimsier models did. Wheels are seemingly good quality. The body looks quite durable and scratch resistant, the zipper is good quality, oh and there's even a lock. It holds a lot of stuff for how small it is, and it is expandable which is helpful for people who sometimes overpack.UPDATE: Suitcase held up perfectly over 4 four flights over the holidays, on two of which it actually had to be checked because the flight was very full. Not a single scratch or dent, no signs of wear, and it was easy to travel with - rolled smoothly and easily, sturdy handle.\",\n",
       "   'This is a very good quality suitcase.  It was the first hard case that I\\'ve bought.  For the most part, I am satisfied, but I wish I had known a couple more bits of information before I purchased.  If you are also buying YOUR FIRST HARD CASE, read these IMPORTANT TIPS.  TIP #1: This case closes with a ZIPPER ONLY.  It does not have a latch.  Zipper-only hard cases are more vulnerable to malfunction because zippers can break or split apart with stress or excessive wear.  If the zipper splits on this case, you do will have a latch as a backup method to keep your case closed and you may find your self in a predicament when you need to check your broken-zippered bag at the airport.  Therefore, if you buy this case, be sure to also buy luggage straps.  Luggage straps are extremely effective to keep your case closed and will help prevent excessive stress or damage to the zipper.  When buying luggage straps, write your initials on each strap with a permanent marker.  This will not only help identify your bag in a busy airport, but also make the straps less desirable for thieves.  TIP #2: I bought the (very large) 28-inch version of this case because I wanted to have plenty of space to pack for long international trips.  In hindsight, I wish I had bought a size or two smaller because filling up a case this big with normal items like clothing, shoes, and toiletries will almost always put you over the airline weight limits (and be very heavy to lift).  The case is very light, but I can only fill it up about 75% to avoid paying the \"excess weight\" fees.  With the case being 25% empty, I have lots of open space in the bag and my belongings bounce around inside.  When I arrive at my destination, I often find my loosely packed belongings out of order and disheveled.  For my next suitcase, I will buy something a tad bit smaller so I can fill 90% or 100%.  When filled to 90-100%, my belongings would be tightly packed and more secure inside.',\n",
       "   'Awesome color, package arrived without an issue. Texture feels amazing, basic compartments with good space and the wheel test was 10/10. This thing can almost roll by themselves.',\n",
       "   \"So far so good; I've flown on 4 international flights and 12 domestic (USA) since I bought. Hasn't seem to scuff or dented anywhere and haven't had anything break on it. Only drawback I did notice was it doesn't allow things to adhere to the material easily; for example stickers or tape. Is a great size to fit everything and the separate compartments work well. Only thing I would advise is maybe an improvement on the zipper on the one mesh screen side. Overall is quality luggage that has done the job for me many times for my business trips.\",\n",
       "   \"I purchased the Samsonite Omni PC Hardside Expandable Luggage 3-Piece Set probably 2 years ago, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This luggage set has truly exceeded my expectations in several ways.Durability: The hardside design of this luggage is incredibly robust and has withstood the rigors of travel exceptionally well. After numerous trips, there's hardly a scratch to be found, and the luggage still looks as good as new.Spaciousness: The three different sizes provide ample space for packing, whether it's a short weekend getaway or a more extended vacation. The expandable feature is a lifesaver when I come back with more souvenirs than I initially planned.Maneuverability: The spinner wheels make navigating airports and crowded terminals a breeze. They glide smoothly in all directions, eliminating the need to tip or drag heavy luggage.Security: The built-in TSA-approved combination locks provide peace of mind when checking in luggage. It's reassuring to know that my belongings are secure.Organization: The interior compartments and dividers help keep my items organized during transit. It's easy to find what I need without rummaging through everything.Stylish Design: The sleek and modern design of this luggage set adds a touch of sophistication to my travels.In summary, the Samsonite Omni PC Hardside Expandable Luggage 3-Piece Set is an outstanding investment for travelers. It combines durability, functionality, and style, making it an excellent choice for anyone who values quality luggage. I highly recommend this set to fellow travel enthusiasts.\",\n",
       "   \"Let me start by saying I am a longtime Samsonite fan. All of my luggage has been Samsonite. I travel a-l-o-t for work and have loved the Samsonite brand for durability and travel smarts. Well, so far, this luggage set seems to be pretty durable but as far as the travel smarts... they missed the mark when it comes to the wheels.Let's start with the Good. I went with hard-sided this time as these are the polycarbonate which hold up far better to the grind of being thrown around by luggage handlers at the airports. From all of my reading, the non-polycarbonate type just don't hold up to that. Not to mention, much of my type of travel (I work in the film industry) is in and out of cars, along side my kit and other gear being loaded in and out... so lots of tossing and banging around. And they have held up like a champ so far (about a year of ownership so far & many, many trips since). Since they are hard sided, they lack the various external pockets that their non-hard sided counterparts have, but that is par for the course and is a trade-off for the durability.  They do have a much better clothing strap system inside than my previous Samsonite luggage. It really seems to hold everything in place far better and snug. In addition, on the one side has that typical zippered net closure as well. All three pieces have the expandability zippers and surprisingly (for this consummate overpacker), I don't need to utilize them much... nice to have though.One sort of wonky thing for me is, that they have an integrated TSA compatible lock that the zippers connect into, with a combination you can set. It's wonky because I have a difficult time with it. Maybe it's because of the length of my nails as I keep them fairly long, I have no idea. And it's not that I can't use it, I just seem to fight with it, especially the combination dials. Some may not have issues with it... might just be me.My biggest issue is the wheels... they just stink. I mean, horrible. The only ones that are somewhat okay, are on the biggest suitcase, but even that.. they just don't wheel great. Especially on any sort of carpet or textured surface... which is well, many surfaces you are rolling it on.  And when you get any sort of bump... like a transition at a doorway, forget it... they just won't go over it.  And the smaller suitcases? Ugh... just awful for wheeling. Most people like to or Need to attach some other bag to the handle of their main suitcase. Whether that be a toiletry bag, a computer bag a backpack or something else.... I haven't found one that doesn't want to dump the suitcase over. And trying to roll them, with something on top, attached to handle is like pushing it through quicksand. The concept that these are supposed to be spinner wheels is completely lost. You are constantly fighting it!  I literally give up and use them all like an old school suitcase that only has two wheels! Which defeats the purpose of buying a suitcase set with spinner wheels. And the smaller the suitcase, the worse it gets. The largest suitcase, when it's full... it's very difficult for me to use in a non-upright position as it's heavy. It's easier to roll as it has more weight to it (when full), but it's still difficult. Samsonite definitely missed the mark with these wheels. It's sad as it's the first luggage set I've not really been happy with.I'm just fortunate that most of my travel is by car and I usually have a cart with me for my mobile office so it's not as important. If I was traveling more by plane... I'd really be annoyed and probably would have returned it. The wheels are just horrible. So if you are traveling a lot where the wheels on the suitcase are expressly important.. make sure you test these out sufficiently or just try something else, as much as this Samsonite fan is pained to say that.\",\n",
       "   'This is one of the most spacious AND lightest carry-on rollers on the market. I can easily pack 5 days worth of clothes in this suit case. Two things that caused me not to give it 5 stars:1. The wheels aren’t great. Immediately I noticed that and it wasn’t as smooth as my TravelPro. Reading the reviews, you’ll see that, and bad wheels can lead to future problems if you ever take this suitcase on anything other than a smooth indoor floor. I decided to buy nice (roller-blade like) wheels with sealed bearings. You’ll need 43x18mm to fit this suitcase. Also, you’ll need a hacksaw to remove the old wheels. There’s YouTube videos out there if you need help.2. The collapsing handle has a lot of give in it and the original wheels will make it worse overtime. There are some internal screws that you can tighten. Also, you don’t need to fully extend the handle when in use. Pull it all the way up, then drop it down one notch. This reduces the “wobblyness” in the handle.With these adjustments, this is a great suitcase in the $100 range. The finish is nice and does not scuff like the Away and Monos that are $250 and higher. My wife has the Monos equivalent to mine and it is a superb piece of luggage at more than twice the price as my Samsonite. That being said, I’m now extremely happy with this Samsonite after the upgraded wheels.',\n",
       "   'I bought this luggage for an upcoming 2-week trip. I love the color, but I also did some research before making my purchase. Samsonite makes quality luggage and I read that a hard-sided luggage is more durable than what I usually use. I hope to have this luggage last me a very long time and I will do it in style. The radiant pink color will stand out, make it easy to spot, and it is pretty. The luggage is very roomy, has the expandable feature, locks, and wheel. I love it!',\n",
       "   'I’ve owned this for a month or so now. I’ve been on about 15 flights or so and it seems to be holding up. It does seem very resistant to scratches. The wheels could certainly be better. Sometimes, they don’t roll as smoothly as expected. The wheels are plastic, showing a lot of wear already and I envision that they’ll be the first to go. I haven’t had any trouble with the handle, but it doesn’t feel strong. I knew I would be traveling a lot and samsonite offered a 10 year warranty, which was a big motive for my purchase.',\n",
       "   'This suitcase has served me well for the last year and a half. On my last trip, one of the wheels fell off. I was disappointed but decided to try to fix it myself. Unfortunately, the part where the wheel attached to the suitcase had deformed when the screws came out, so it had structural damage.  Little did I realize st the time how good samsonite’s warranty is. I dropped off my luggage at the local Samsonite store on Easter Sunday, paid the $20 deductible, and by Wednesday afternoon I had an email stating the suitcase was fixed and on its way back. I can’t fault a company that stands behind what it sells.',\n",
       "   'I am heading out on my trip next week so I will let you know if it holds up. This is my first luggage purchase in 15 years. My other was a soft case - 30 inch and I took it every where until the zipper finally broke. Hoping this Hard case will hold the next 15!',\n",

We had it in 2 days, just as pictured and described and not available locally.',\n",
       "   'Granted I’ve only used it once for a weeklong trip, but I believe it’s going to be the best piece of luggage I’ve ever bought. Durable, lightweight, lots of storage space, rolls incredible, and I love the TSA-Approved lock.',\n",

It is more of an off-white, with a slight blue tinge to it. This was the biggest surprise. I still like its visibility on the airport luggage carousel, but I would have liked it to be pure bright white.- I took two European trips with it and noticed some damage to the shell (a small crack). I know airlines are rough on luggage, but I was hoping it would be undamaged for much longer.- Obviously, an off-white color means that it gets dirty quickly, and it does. There were lots of black scuff marks, but I was expecting that, and they would probably clean off quickly.- This is fine with this particular luggage/brand or model, but more a general problem for this size of luggage: The larger size is massive, as big as it is allowed by most airlines. You will likely not be able to fill it without going over 50 lbs. You will hit the weight limit well before you hit the size limit.  Bringing two large ones and a medium one (remember, I bought two sets) made it challenging to fit in UberXL cars, and I had to rent full-size station wagons (annoying when driving in Europe) and it was still challenging to fit.In conclusion, if I could choose again, I'd buy a set with a smaller large size and look for something pure-white color. I also might find something with a more robust shell, but I realize it would probably be heavier.\",\n",

It's held up well.- It's lightweight, and doesn't waste space in the interior with the design.- It always fit in the overhead bin- The wheels don't get in the way of zipping (I've heard some people complain about inadvertently touching wheels because of the design on some cases, but I've never experienced that with this one).- It's usually the distinctive one on the conveyer belt (color), but I also use a distinctive luggage tag.- Pricepoint is spot on for the use I have had out of it so far and how it's held up so far.CONS- even this small version can be packed beyond acceptable weight limits because it's quite roomy (and I also use compression packing cubes), so be mindful of that depending on the airline's restrictions for carry on and overhead size.- The wheels are good, but could be better. They become troubled when you walk too fast, and if you try and put a bag on top of the case. It's still maneuverable, but have to be more careful. The weight makes a difference.\",\n",

       "   'Now that I\\'ve had the chance to travel with this, I can finally give my full review. I purchased the carry-on size for a trip overseas and based on the reviews, I chose this particular carry-on size since most people shared that it fits the overhead bins of most airlines. Obviously, double-check YOUR specific airline before purchasing, just to be safe!So let\\'s start with the COLOR - I opted for the \"Caribbean Blue\" color and it is a very noticeable shade of blue, which was great since I was able to identify my suitcase as it went through security and as I also checked it during my flight back home. In terms of DESIGN - this is a hardshell case and it is quite sturdy. I have been a loyal Samsonite customer for years and so I had good faith in the quality and design of this suitcase. The suitcase does come with a TSA-approved lock system, which you use by setting your own code.I was able to easily navigate the luggage. However, the WHEELS at some point were a bit awkward. When rolling it sideways, sometimes there was a weird lag to it, but otherwise, it was able to smoothly roll through carpet, tile, and whatever surface I put it through haha.Now to the important part - STORAGE - I am an over-packer, and yes, I did need to EXPAND this suitcase to accommodate my clothes and shoes. initially, I had used packing cubes but found it too clunky and took up too much space and therefore, simply opted for the rolling method instead.So as a CARRY-ON, even when expanded this suitcase did fit my JetBlue overhead compartment. I was super nervous that it wouldn\\'t but thank heavens it did! As a CHECKED BAG, this survived the brutality of the luggage carousel and the manhandling from the airport workers and I was so happy that it came back to me in tact.Overall, I am very pleased with this suitcase and cannot wait to use it some more for future trips to come! Highly recommend!',\n",

       "   'I purchased the 3 pieces set because the 29\" expandable was not available by itself in the color I wanted in the time I needed it.  I was surprised at how light this suitcase is and also, being so big, easy to handle.  I was able to fit everything I needed and still had plenty of room without having to expand it.  I feel that if you expand such a big suitcase, it may become less stable and harder to move around.  Keep in mind that these wonderful spinner wheels are made to run smoothly only on airport surfaces - no rugs, or sidewalks.  I had a slightly more difficult time rolling it from the parking lot to the terminal as the road surfaces are rougher and less even.  Aside from that, it makes a world of a difference to use a spinner rather than the traditional 2 wheeled suitcases.  I own a fabric Travel Pro set that is in very good shape and I have used for many years but it has 2 wheels and it is much heavier - so time to upgrade.  I am happy with  my purchase.  As far as the dimensions, I don\\'t know who took them - I was worried that the 29 inch would be too big and I would have to pay over size charges but NOPE.  I  measured it right out of the box and the overall dimensions including the wheels was 61 inches (length + width + height) which is under the 62\" maximum required by the airlines.  I packed stuff for 8 days and even though I was allowed 70 lb. in my checked baggage, I was only at 62 lbs.  The weight of the suitcase itself is a big help.  I did see a few superficial scratches on it, only after the first trip, but it is to be expected.  I am not worried about scratches - they are inevitable - in my opinion.  So with that said, I will most likely end up buying another set for my husband.  The carryon is also the perfect size and I was pleasantly surprised at how much stuff I can fit in it.  I used to to stuff all the heavy goodies I bought abroad, including liquids, and I checked it as a regular bag.  The medium 25\" is a good size - no so medium - more like a large suitcase but I have not used it yet.  I believe the 25\" is most likely going to be my clothing suitcase and the larger one will be the everything else and souvenir b ag - as it holds tons of stuff.  Very happy with my purchase.',\n",

I just used it for the the first time though and was not pleased with the way it rolled with the additional weight of the other bag.  Without the bag it was much easier to maneuver.

She had to have the lock cut out because she was leaving the next day. If you make the same mistake, make sure you leave enough time between testing the lock and your trip so you can go to a licensed Samsonite dealer to undo the lock.',\n",
       "   'Finally got the chance to use this luggage set.  Just spent nearly a month touring Europe with this set.  We flew to Paris from Chicago.  Then we flew from Paris to Madrid and then from Madrid to Rome.  Then we took trains all over Italy, a cruise throughout Greece and some other stops in Monaco and France.  We carried not only enough clothes for a long trip but we also got married in the Greek Islands so we also had a wedding gown and tux in here as well.  To say that our luggage needed to be spacious, easily maneuverable, and strong enough to bear up to that much travel without wrecking our clothes is an understatement.  We chose Samsonite as my previous set was 16 years old and still going strong.  To see how the all wheel luggage performed we went to a nearby Samsonite store.  The ultra lite series seemed entirely too flimsy for our needs and we decided on this set.  I read all the reviews online and, despite being concerned about the one review I saw about the large bag being beyond regulation size, I ordered this set.  Now on the other side of our trip I can tell you not once did any airline mention the bag\\'s total dimensions (to be honest I\\'ve never seen an airline baggage handler with a tape measure and really think they only care if it makes weight) and how many times we discussed during the trip how great this luggage set had performed.  We planned at the start that we would pack without unzipping the 2\" extensions to start and would know we had bought enough souvenirs once all three bags had been extended.  It all worked exactly as planned.  The bags were sturdy and well balanced.  We were easily able to put our backpacks and carryon bags on top of these and not need to keep a hold of them to keep them from tipping.  We did get one scratch on the large bag but it is not really noticeable.  Hope this long review helps as I was on the fence from the previous reviews on whether to buy or not and knew I would give this set the great review it deserved once home.',\n",

Now I have to ship the product to a repair center at my own expense, even though it is brand new, since there are no authorized repair centers within 300 miles.

It scoffs at rough handling, chuckles at scratches, and has a hearty laugh at dents.And the spinner wheels! They should have their own Olympic event. They spun so smoothly, I half expected the suitcase to break into an ice-skating routine right there in the airport terminal. Whether we were making a mad dash for the gate or gracefully sidestepping foot traffic, this suitcase twirled with the grace of a prima ballerina.As for the expandable feature, it's like a magic trick.

Note a small tool is included for tightening screws on scooter as needed in the future.The two-in-one style is great.

I selected this unit based on the good reviews and competitive price, in addition to the ability to use the scooter sitting or standing. Overall I've been happy so far.Assembly is very easy, almost idiot proof, connect the handle to the base and your done. The handle is held in place by a small plastic pin but seems very stable and secure so far. I used the allen wrench they supplied to tighten everything that could be tightened, but overall assembly was done in less than 10 minutes. The seat can be removed, or the height changed, with a nut and both designed to be tightened by hand, without the tool. I did have one issue with this unit, with the seat. The seat does not sit entirely aligned with the foot plate. It is just a bit  off center, but enough that you can see it when looking at the seat from above. As if the holes on the handle bar were drilled just slightly off lone. So far it has not been an issue, and the use of the unit has not been affected, but it is something to be aware of. Its not something I am going to return the unit for.The switch from sitting to standing has been seem less so far with adult help, the seat is a bit to tight for a toddler to full lift up and press down. Seat height adjustment is quick and easy, as is the ability to unclamp the handle bar and change the height up or down. The wheels light up and roll smoothly, as they are supposed to do. There are foot rests at the base where the handle bar attaches to the foot plate, but I can't see a time those are ever going to be used. The brakes work when in standing position, but your child won't be able to get to them when sitting on the seat as they are directly behind you. My grandson just uses the bottoms of his shoes like his brother does.I rated this as 4 stars due to the alignment issue with the seat as that is a quality control issue, both of on the manufacturing side and with the quality control inspection which should have caught it. Otherwise I would have rated this as a 5 star purchase.\",\n",

You will see in my video that I add my favorite creamer before my latte brews. I like mine a little sweet, and that’s what works for me. I have bought some organic syrups and can’t wait to try those, too. It has been so much fun and a delicious experience getting to know my machine.I will try to keep my review list short and simple:Pros:*Makes a delicious coffee beverage (haven’t tried iced coffee yet, but I’m certain it won’t disappoint*Reminds you to clean the milk spout with a touch of a button when finished making your milk based drinks, as you will see in my video*Automatically does a quick rinse of the coffee/water spout when turned on or off, as you will see in my video (always keep a small cup there to catch the water)*Allows to reconfigure settings to your preference and memorizes the settings you chose - I.e. more water, less foam, etc. (you can find videos on how to change settings - super easy)*Has a decent sized water tank that provides multiple drinks before filling up again*VERY easy to learn and start making coffee right out of the box (just be sure to follow initial cleaning steps first)*Accommodates whole beans and ground coffee (be sure to read how to do ground coffee, as the machine is supposed to be on, can’t go over a certain amount at a time, etc. - easy to grasp but I want you to get it right)*Alerts when it’s time to refill water tank or remove coffee grounds from its disposal tank.*Very quick process and well worth the drink - it’s definitely a treat for my husband and me.*Has a hot water feature for teas, oatmeal, etc. You pick how much you need (no preset for that, I don’t think). Just be sure to have the hot water spout attached (original spout that you remove to attach the milk container for milk based drinks)*Very hot temperature, which I love. Just be aware and careful when you first brew and take that first sip. Temperature can be adjusted - just watch a YouTube video or read the manual to learn how.Cons:*Ive only found one, and I could be mistaken. But I don’t recall getting an alert when my beans needed refilled. I am new to ground beans and maybe it expects we know how many we should use. I don’t yet know, so I put enough beans in to cover the base. However, I could tell it was out during one of my drinks because I didn’t hear a strong grind. The drink was not good. Not a big deal, but it’s worth calling out if you’re wondering or like me and a newbie to whole beans. We will get it down!I love this machine, and I am so thankful it was on a deal. We splurged and got it for Christmas for us. My advice - don’t wait another morning without this machine. You deserve this; You won’t be disappointed.',\n",
       "   'I don\\'t write reviews often and wanted to wait about 6 months to see if I still like the Magnifica Eva. So the answer is yes! I shopped various others and at the end opted for this one because it really does make high-level espresso drinks with a \\'one-button\\' approach. So here are some pro\\'s, con\\'s, and highlights:Pros: Very simple to use once you get past the instructions. They do need to improve these. But it does make excellent coffee with minimal care. You just have to follow the descaling instructions every few weeks. We use it multiple times a day and it has not failed at all. Also it doesn\\'t consume much counter space.Cons: Well we have all got used to touchsceens with easy instructions. This is not that machine. Harken back to the 2000\\'s when multi-function buttons were the thing. But once you get used to those, it is very predictable. The water reservoir is a bit on the small side so if you are a big coffee drinker, you will have to fill it daily. Also I haven\\'t used the foaming milk attachments since I really don\\'t want to clean those and a battery whisk is much simpler.Pro-tips: 1) Use espresso roast beans. They just work better. The per-cup cost is very low since the grinder is very efficient. 2) The isn\\'t much useful guidance on the grinding adjustment settings. After much experimentation, I feel that setting the knob to a  \"5\" worked the best for me. 3) Empty the drip tray daily and give it a quick rinse.Overall I am very pleased. While the instructions are a bit archaic, you can can understand them with a bit of effort.',\n",

Finally, in conclusion, they told me the machine have to be replaced with a new one and their department will contact me by email in two to five working days. Because I don't have from them any information after that time I called again and they told me to wait two days more for instructions. Finally, they called me back and informed me that they do not have on the stock the machine for replacement.Fortunately, I purchased this mahine from Amazon, and I have an open window to return through Amazon.

       "   \"12 month update: We still absolutely love the De'Longhi Magnifica.  No issues whatsoever.  Guests all rave about how simple the machine is to use, no one needs to clean a portafilter, and drinks taste wonderful.  Price has dropped over the past year, it's totally worth it!3 Month Update: Still loving the De'Longhi Magnifica. Zero issues using it. It’s fast, straightforward, and worth every penny.Here's my coffee journey through many, many years: Mr. Coffee -->mini-espresso-->French Press-->pour over—>Keurig-->Breville-->De'Longhi.I LOVE this De'Longhi Magnifica!  If I had to narrow it down to one reason, it's that I do not have to wash a portafilter each time I make espresso!  Honesty, this is worth every penny.  We make 2-6 espressos or coffee nearly every day and some days I would just skip the drink if I have to wash everything again.Not only does this Magnifica deal with the portafilter for me, I can make a plain cup of coffee, tea, or use other grounds to make any drink.You can make espresso drinks (hot/cold), coffee, tea, froth milk.  So many options in one machine with very little clean up.At first I was a bit overwhelmed with the buttons, but a little practice and it was a cinch!  The espresso taste great and the options are outstanding.One complaint (which is really minor): the water reservoir is small and must be added to often (lack of water can disrupt a pour).  Every night, after my tea, I fill the water reservoir and the beans to be ready for the morning.  I dump the grounds every 3-5 days (the machine will notify you) and wash everything that needs it.When you turn on and off the machine, it will run a quick clean cycle.  Place a small glass or pitcher underneath and then the tray won't fill up as quickly.My first espresso machine was the Breville, which I have loved for years.  I've retired it for this one and I love the Magnifica!*This machine does not come with a milk pitcher.**The first machine we got had an issue with the steam/water.  Anytime we used the steam/water, the machine would freeze for 20-30 minutes!  I requested a replacement and that issue did not come up with our new machine.Review for De'Longhi ECAM29043SB Magnifica Evo Coffee and Espresso Machine, Silver\",\n",
       "   \"I've owned a few days over two months. and product delivers hot (not scalding) drinks made to excellent standards. For the best results use the best beans, water, double walled glasses. Truly fully automatic.Not complicated but follow directions carefully. Downsides: not a lot of experimentation allowed. Yes you can program a double  - but it's easier to just drop in a second shot of expresso.. Also, Use coldest & freshest 2% milk (or preferred substitute) in creamer and don't store overnight in creamer supply container. Use best supplies and clean/descale etc on schedule or ahead of schedule. If warning indicator comes on - First check water and bean supply, and be sure creamer/foamer is attached firmly. Great product so far.\",\n",
       "   \"Works well but every time it operates it sounds like it's breaking the sound barrier. Very loud...like fighter jet loud.  Also, it doesn't work well with foaming cashew milk (almond and soy are fine), and you cannot make a large latte on one run, you must make two lattes to equate to large.  Otherwise suppose the machine warrants the high price.\",\n",
       "   'I read all the reviews, advice, tutorials, and manuals. I went in prepared with reasonable expectations and was ready to make the adjustments. I was totally blown away. First, I followed the instructions: read all the instructions before unboxing (manual is on the companies website along with a video of a walk through of the process). I had a Saturday morning set aside for set up prepared to make lots of adjustments, so Friday night I unboxed and did my water prime. (Hint- the water filter is a bit tough. I ended up priming without it and coming back to it in the morning. If the filter light won’t stop flashing it’s not o all the way. Also, it flushes a LOT of water after install, empty your basin before doing this step, I overflowed.)Next I set up the espresso settings. Waste at least 3 shot of espresso, then brew a shot to judge BEFORE you make any adjustments to brew strength or grind size. The system needs 3-4 shots to get ready. I didn’t have to make any adjustments. My espresso came out beautiful, just like the picture tasting amazing with a light fruity finish -(Lavazzo espresso Barista Gran Crema whole bean).Last I set up the Lattecrema system. Lots of reviews say it doesn’t make much froth, but all I had in the house was lactose free skim milk and my macchiato had an inch of foam on top.All of my drinks have been piping hot, and even my plain cup of coffee had a head of crema offer brewing.I’m kind of in love with this machine. I’ve named him. I’ve had way too much coffee this morning.I have always wanted a coffee maker like this and it has definitely lived up to the hype!',\n",
       "   \"I ordered this machine on December 11th 2022. Up until a few days ago it worked just fine. Now it won't make lattes, espressos, or any coffee whatsoever. The problem started after I hit the descaling button. From that point forward the machine locked. I followed instructions in the manual in an effort to descale the machine even though I had not been alerted by the machine that this was necessary. The machine would not start the descaling process. I tried to reset the machine to factory standards again following instructions in the manual I received with the machine to the letter,but the machine would not do that.I went online to check obtain information I provided when I registered the machine within 14 days of the date I received it. After signing in there was no sign that my machine was ever registered even though I have an email confirming successful registration.While on the Delonghi site I checked to see if I have the right owners manual.The owners manual that came with My machine lists three different model numbers but not mine.My search indicated that the model that I own was no longer being serviced and there was no owners manual to be found. The model number on my Amazon invoice and on the bottom of my machine is ECAM49043SB.I spoke to two service representatives and neither could find my registration but acknowledged that I did register it after I sent them my purchase invoice and email from Deloghi confirming registration.Neither of the reps I spoke with could find my model or its owner manual on the Delonghi web site.I will be calling Delonghi back tomorrow and asking for a new machine and not a refurbished one. If they refuse I'll also be contacting Amazon.I owned this machine's predecessor and used it daily for 10 to 12 years before it died. That's why I decided to buy another one. I guess you can say they don't make them like they used to.Stay tuned. I'll let you know how Delonghi and/or Amazon respond to my warranty request.\",\n",
       "   'I had decided I was tired of going to coffee shops, spending a ton of money and creating more garbage/plastic in the world. I am so grateful I got this machine as I literally do not purchase any coffee outside of my home (unless traveling). I have found my perfect cup for me is 2 x espresso and 1 latte macchiato makes me a perfect cup. And as far as tea goes, it brews a very delicious cup of tea. You can also adjust the water by pressing it a second time (as first time makes about 4 ounces of tea) and when you have your cup filled to your liking, you press the water button again and it will stop the water flow. The temperature of the water is so critical in making an excellent cup of tea, and this machine accomplishes this beautifully. I do wish I had the option to only steam milk to make a London fog latte ( but I also haven’t really done a lot of research to see if I can accomplish this- to be fair).',\n",
       "   \"This machine is everything I hoped it would be. It makes delicious drinks quickly at the push of a button and takes care of its own cleaning. My only complaint is that I can't easily change beans. Now that I can make espresso so easily I want to drink it all day but can't switch to decaf without using preground coffee, which doesn't come out nearly as good. I might just make it a decaf machine permanently and get my caffeine some other way!\",\n",
       "   'Really like this machine, 8/10. If you want to taste a craft coffee roasters but wish that the barrista would make it for you - this is a great match. Things to consider:1) READ THE MANUAL - this machine is very sensitive and it needs a person who follows the instructions, especially during the decalc function2) NO GRINDING FLEXIBILITY - if you change the grinder’s setting, it will take at least 4 espressos to adjust to the grinding.3) DON’t EXPECT VERY HIGH PRESSURE - this is a vibratory propulsion system and you can’t experiment with the coffee that is ground super finely',\n",
       "   'Machine works well. The milk frother stopped working but I contacted Support and they identified the problem as well as provided detailed instructions on how to clean the milk frothing system. Additional information on cleaning cycles for the frother would be helpful.',\n",
       "   'With cheap beans output coffee is  absolutely unsaturated,  despite the fact you can make good coffee from cheap beans in dzhezva.  So,  this machine is more or less good only with very high quality coffee beans.',\n",
       "   \"Ok, that'll probably sounds like a click-grabber since it's the first that I've actually owned. But it's not the first I've used and it seems on par with much more expensive machines I've frequently used (and drooled over).Set-up was easy and after doing the initial pump-priming I was ready for my first espresso. After the recommended 1st couple of runs I was ready for my first espresso to drink.It took a few tries to get the balance of grind level/coffee strength to where I wanted it (which was expected) but the pulls are pretty consistently where I want them now. My moment of fear was when I chocked it by making the grinds too fine while I had the strength up to max. I calmed down and figured this out after I looked at the troubleshooting to find what the angry little lights meant and dialed back the grind settings and all was fine. Lesson learned: Don't turn the grind setting wheel too much at a time. Baby steps. My expectation is that if I change the type of beans I'm using I'll probably have to tweak it, but again that's expected.Those few times when I want a latte or cappuccino the LatteCrema system is a nice alternative to the more time consuming manual process. I got that option mostly for my wife so she could easily make her own cappuccinos and that alone was worth the price of the option. Fat free milk seems to work best for a thicker foam. Higher fat seems to = bigger bubbles.As others have commented the water container could have been larger. The rinsing cycles will help you go through a lot of water but I appreciate the rinsing to keep all the 'pipes' clean. The LatteCrema system also does it's own rinse cycle which will contribute to the water usage as well. But overall a very small issue and it's easy enough to refill it. Might be nice if they did an 'extended' tank that extends out from the side, but I doubt that we'll see that.Time will tell on durability. I'm sure taking care of the machine correctly will be a factor in that. As in any automatic device they're more complicated with many moving parts. Your typical coffee machine has a lot less break points and moving parts than an automated one. As a result it will be important to follow the maintenance directions to keep it running and in tip-top shape.UPDATE: 3 months in and I'm still very happy with the machine, no issues. I've been cleaning it monthly and it's pretty easy. Been putting a new filter in monthly. Personally I've found I like the medium espresso roasts with an Arabica/Robusta blend. So far we've been using Lavazza beans exclusively because the quality/freshness has been good as has the price point. In three months we've gone thru about 6 KG (13 LB) of beans so I guess we're drinking a fair bit of espresso?\",\n",
       "   'We have been using this machine for almost 3 months now.  I would have purchased a different machine if I had used this previous to purchase.1.  Too much water waste.  The machine flushes when turned on and when it shuts off.  There is no way to just leave it on.  The longest is 3 hours.  If you want coffee throughout the day, you may end up turning it on again and it will flush the system again.2.  It does not let you know when the water is low.  It will make you a partial cup if it is near time to fill.  It wastes beans because of this.3. It does not let you know when beans need added.  It again, will make you a cup of water when the beans are low.4.  We have tried to use the grounds feature and the coffee just slides down into the waste tray.  It does not work.5.  The milk frother stopped frothing the milk after the first week.  It warms it, but does not froth it.We add water to this machine a lot because of the flushing.  It is NOT worth the money charged.  We like the coffee it makes, but with all the other issues I would not recommend this machine.',\n",
       "   \"The De'Longhi Magnifica Evo is an all-in-one brewing station that aims to bring coffee shop style drinks to your kitchen at a more affordable price than many of its competitors. My favorite feature of this machine is the milk container. It's designed with convenience in mind. You can fill the container at any time and even leave it in your fridge. When you're ready to make drinks, just attach it to the machine. After making drinks, the De'Longhi will prompt you to run a clean cycle, which you can do with milk still in the container! The wand is steam cleaned and never touches the milk inside. Then you can disconnect the container and put it back in the fridge. No wasted milk! The only downside is that making a large basic cup of coffee isn't as easy as the other drinks because of the way the machine is designed to make espresso type drinks. One is limited to a smaller cup of regular coffee, so it's not ideal for filling a travel mug on your way out the door. However, all things considered, this machine does all the drinks listed in the menu system very well, including the smaller cup of coffee. Another thing to note is that although it mentions iced coffee, it still brews the coffee hot, and you add it over your own ice. Other machines can make colder brews, but this isn't one of them. Another feature I appreciate is the simplicity. It's a one-button push system, with no profiles for different drinks. They even added a hot water option for tea. This is a big plus for tea drinkers like me who enjoy a strong cup of black tea. The machine makes the water hot enough to brew tea nicely. Most all-in-one systems don't bother with tea, so it's great that they included it. Overall, it's an outstanding machine that will appeal to coffee drinkers who want coffee shop style drinks with simplicity in making them. I was really impressed by how professional this machine made my drinks. I am happy to save money instead of going to the coffee shop every morning.\",\n",
       "   \"I did a lot of research and waited for the price deals on Amazon before buying this machine last November. We have been using it ever since and are very pleased with the performance, flexibility and quality of the espressos, cappuccinos and coffees that it makes.It is very quick to cycle up and produces hot water, about 10-15 seconds, and the whole grind to espresso process takes less than a minute. It is also a lot quiter than I anticipated. We have a cat who doesn't like loud noises and this has never bothered him.I have also tried making coffee using pre-ground beans and while it works, it doesn't taste as good. It is pretty much the same taste as making it in an automatic drip coffee machine.There are only two minor things I wish were better. First, it doesn't take long for the coffee pucks to trigger the sensor that you need to empty the bin. I have seen this happen after only 4-5 uses. The bin isn't full at all, it just requires you to push the pucks down.Second, while the tray under the machine slides out easily for cleaning, there is always a little bit of coffee grounds at the very back of the tray that can fall out as you remove the tray. This is really more of an annoyance than anything.Beyond that, I would highly recommend this espresso machine to anyone.\",\n",
       "   'This the second Delonghi cappuccino machines i have owned.  Delonghi makes a good product.  This new improved version is easier to use and the coffee it produces is not bitter, and it steams the milk more efficiently.  If you like a quality latte or cappuccino this is the home machine to buy.',\n",
       "   \"The De'Longhi Magnifica Evo™ with the LatteCrema system is easy to work. The packaging is really secure and they have package it really well. Next was getting all the tape off and washing the different removable parts with warm water and a mild detergent. Finally, it was time to make some magic happen. We plugged it in and got it primed, that step is simple to do. Next, we added our beans and the LatteCrema system and made a wonderful cappuccino. It was a bit noisy at every step of the process from grinding to brewing, but so worth it for the drinks that it produces! Overall, it worked wonderfully and made very delicious drinks. It has a rinse feature to help clean out the extra milk from the LatteCrema system, such an added bonus. Once done brewing it disposes of the coffee grounds in a little bin, you take the bin a dump the grounds and away you go! The machine came with a water hardness tester, water filter, and some descaler. Very impressive machine! I highly recommend this for anyone wanting speciality drinks at home it can just do hot water too.\",\n",
       "   'Prompt delivery.  Excellent coffee maker.  Easy to use.',\n",
       "   'The coffee that comes out of this machine is straight up amazing. It looks, smells, and tastes like I\\'m getting it from a gourmet restaurant. I\\'ve tried one cappuccino so far and that was delicious as well. It took me and my wife a few minutes of playing with it to figure out the buttons and I guess the system needed a cycle or two to start working seamlessly but since we figured it out, it\\'s been amazing. If you can afford it and appreciate a fantastic cup of coffee or cappuccino, I fully endorse it. My wife has used the tea setting (it heats water very quickly) and we\\'ll keep exploring with the other types of drinks.You can use either whole ground beans, just be careful that you put the right type of bean in the right spot (they don\\'t go in the same place). Water level is easy to check, the nozzle adjusts so you can control how foamy you like your coffee (I keep it at the \"most foam\" level because it\\'s perfect), and cleaning isn\\'t difficult but you do want to make sure you understand what parts come off for routine cleaning - for instance, after using milk for cappuccino, you have to clean the milk reservoir and tubes to avoid ganky milk nastiness. It\\'s normal and it\\'s easy, you just have to be deliberate and do it. Also, the machine will run a little water through the pipes to keep them clean and while it has a drip pan to catch that sort of thing, I recommend keeping a cup under the spout for simplicity.',\n",
       "   'This appliance is great after you go through literally several rounds of qualifying adjustments. Once you make an adjustment it takes a few rounds for equipment to adjust and there were times it has red lights turning on many times thinking you got a defect. Be patient. It took about 30-40 mins to go through adjustments tweaking and then equipment qualification runs before you got the best tasting coffee. The coffee crema for espresso was fabulous.Here are some notes to consider like others pointed out:1) do not miss the priming for the very first time. Does take about half of the water tank and it does take about 15 mins.  When you turn the steamer dial I turned it until it clicked and nothing happened. Just turn it to the left but don’t turn it as far as the click. Hot water will stream out for a long time making you think this is wrong. It is not. It’s priming the appliance to go through parts of the appliance for the first time.2) adjusting the coarse or fine for grinder is on the daisy wheel inside the grinder. Keep in mind when it’s grinding that’s when you adjust. Then run it twice for the appliance to register new settings. Really follow the page 9 direction on what it should look like flowing like honey.3) turning off the appliance sets it into auto cleaning so keep a mug underneath for water to spit out after a cleaning cycle.Once you got the adjustments there’s nothing like freshly ground coffee brewing. The crema was great and we used lavazza coffee super crema beans as well as Lilly brands. Of course we used almost half of the bag just adjusting and getting used to the controls. I was getting impatient but finally the appliance went through its steps and now works flawlessly.It’s Italian engineering and is UL listed. So the way Europe establishes controls are different than what is Americans are exposed to. But it is a very sophisticated system with learning capability.',\n",

       "   \"Where to start?  There are so many good things about the DeLonghi Magnifica Evo coffee maker.  This is a sleek looking machine that I am happy to have on my kitchen counter.  It is super easy to use and is intuitive.  It offers a large water reservoir, cutting down on the number of times one has to refill.  The Magnifica Evo can be used with either whole beans or ground coffee, making it one of the most versatile coffee makers on the market.  the adjustable brew head can accommodate a variety of large or small cups, making it easy to pull a single shot of espresso, or a larger mug of coffee.  It also holds a considerable amount of beans, and is quiet when grinding.  This machine also does a pre and post rinse of the brew head, making sure it's clean and free of any residue.  This feature ensures a fresh cup with every pull.  The Evo has a LatteCrema system which consists of a milk container and frother.  One can add dairy or plan based milk, and make a latte or cappuccino with a single touch.  Again, the milk container is easy to use, and can be popped out of the machine and placed in the refrigerator if there is milk left over.  There is also a self cleaning function that shoots hot water through the spout, ensuring there is no milk left in the spout to turn sour.  The brewing cycle is short, there is pretty much no wait time.  One of the best features, it truly is a one-touch system, offering a number of different drinks in an instant.  The coffee drinks are smooth and creamy, brewing a really mellow cup without any bitter or acidic notes.  The Magnifica Evo is a keeper, a sleek machine that makes a great tasting coffee of my choice, all at the push of a button.\",\n",

       "   \"I acquired the coffee machine since few days ago. It has been a literal Game Changer in my morning routine. Previously I had a manual coffee machine from De'longhi. It was tedious but it almost always made a consistently good coffee. Every morning I would take 10 min to do my coffee. Between grinding the beans, warming and frotting the milk, and letting the machine goes to temperature, it was a whole process I started to resent once I also had to take care of a little human being. Now, I start the machine, let it clean itself, plug in the LatteCrema System, and it does its magic! The only thing I regret is not buying it sooner. I tried to do some Ube Latte, and some Almond and Hazelnut milk latte, and it works consistently great with alternative milk or flavored milk. It is a great upgrade for anyone who loves good fresh ground bean coffee without the struggle of making it! Concerning the setup, it took me a good 30 min as you also have to set up the machine depending on the hardness of the water. but the rest was pretty straightforward. So far, I have no complaints and I am utterly satisfied with my new machine.Little note: As it has an automatic cleaning system, you will need a small recipient on the side to catch the water when you start and turn off the machine and when you clean the steam wand for the LatteCrema system. You also have to change some settings if you change the type of beans you are using. You can also use espresso ground coffee using the spoon provided for measurement, but nothing else beats fresh ground coffee though.\",\n",
       "   \"As mentioned in the title I really like the De'Longhi Magnifica Evo. The coffee machine is easy to use and almost makes you feel like a barista at home. With all the pre-programmed coffees the machine is easy to use and requires no complicated setup before usage. Even the 'simpler option', making hot water for a tea, is really nice to use as before this machine we always heated some water in a pan.Additionally I also really like how easy it is to clean the machine, whereas with other machines this can be a hassle the Magnifica Evo has a built in program that requires minimal manual work. Same goes for the separate milk tank, when you are not using milk for your Latte's you easily detach the separate milk tank and store it in your fridge.The only 'issue' I had with the coffee machine was the setup of the water reservoir, which comes with a cleaning bottle that needs to be filled with water separately and then be attached in the exact right way to not get an error on the machine. However, after watching a video on YT this problem was quickly solved.Overall me and my family are really enjoying this coffee machine and it is a joy to make coffee every morning!\",\n",
       "   \"Sprung for this as an upgrade to my Delonghi Magnifica I've had for like 5 years or so, when Amazon had a $300 price drop around Christmas. The old machine is still working perfectly. The main upgrade is the automatic frother. I found the seemingly slight nuisance of manual frothing resulted in me only rarely making a latte or cappucino. With the automatic frother it's a lot easier, just fill the little container, press the button and done. Froth is perfect every time so far. Afterward just put the container in the fridge for the next time, top it off when needed. There's a clean button to hit after making a milk drink, it just pumps a little hot water through the system to flush out the milk, just takes a few seconds. The container comes apart into 3 pieces that can go in the dishwasher, though I haven't done that yet.\",\n",

The whole coffee maker is beautifully designed, it is an eye catching centerpiece to the kitchen now! The water tank and the coffee catcher on the insides are hidden but also easy to remove for filling and cleaning. The machine is easy to use but takes a little setting up and cleaning prior to the first use. You can easily switch from the milk frother spout to the hot water spout depending on your drink of choice. I really love having a clean spout for hot water to easily switch between tea and coffee. The milk frother works really well with my dairy free milks as well! This machine creates the freshest coffee you could imagine! Freshly grinds your beans immediately before use, this gives a deliciously nutty flavor to any cup of coffee! You can even adjust how course or fine you grind your beans. The milk container has the levels of milk necessary for all of your favorite coffee beverages. From a simple shot of espresso to a latte to a stronger over ice brew you will never need the coffee shop again! The machine is easy to clean and the instructions are thorough and easy to follow. I can’t imagine being happier with a coffee maker; I couldn’t have imagined that I could make a cup of coffee this delicious! Now on to practicing my latte art!

Girls you know, as soon as you see your barista hand you your coffee you can tell if it’s right by the color and dang it when you know it’s wrong because you just paid $7+ for something you’ll choke down or trash, right? Well no more! This right here is stopping all of that! I read comments on here, it does clean before and after, I just keep a coffee cup near it, put it under the spout when I start it and but it back under when I’m done and boom! trust me, I’m happy that it does it.

It was so easy to get from box to full-on coffee shop, I was making my first cappuccino in minutes. It was gorgeous and delicious. The foam was light and silky and lasted through to the last drop. I used a clear glass mug that you can see in my picture. I mean, it's about flavor and savor, but it also is just so pretty to look at with all that foam. The machine is elegant and streamlined, so it looks great and doesn't take up a lot of counter space. In fact, my husband and I are discussing how many of our old coffee makers this one replaces! It does so many things.  We don't need our tea kettle. We don't need our futzy little espresso maker that took forever to produce a cup of coffee and the foam had to be produced separately while our coffee got cold. I can't get over that I can wake up in the morning tomorrow and push the picture of the coffee drink I want and have a truly European and delicious start to my day. Just wow.\",\n",

I use whole beans and was able to fit a standard bag of coffee in the chamber. You can adjust the coarseness of your grounds for those that enjoy the whole bean experience. There is also a spout to put in pre-ground coffee if that is your preference The Magnifica has several preset options so one press of a button and you get a delicious creamy espresso. The adjustable spout is a great touch and let me make both a cup of regular joe and a gorgeous single shot of espresso. There is also the option to steam milk or run hot water for standalone drinks. I actually used the milk steamer for my oat milk cappuccino and it worked great adding a nice velvet texture. All in all I highly recommend this machine for those that want to a quick and easy cup of delicious coffee as well as those who want to have more choices for their morning beverage.',\n",

We got this machine to replace another whole bean machine, and the Evo blows it out of the water. All you need to do is add beans, water, and milk, and the machine takes care of the rest. We love that there is no need to pack the grinds for an espresso, which seriously sped up our morning routine without any loss of flavour or creaminess. My husband was just saying that we can never go back to packing our own grinds because the Evo is just so much faster.I also love that the machine makes everything fro mixed coffee to cappuccinos, and all in a sleek, modern-looking machine that has a slimmer profile than our last one, which looks great in our kitchen and saves us precious counter space.I also appreciate that there is a large cavity for beans, so we don't have to refill the machine as often. But I also really like that there's a port for pre-ground coffee, which enables us to make regular and decaf coffee without switching out the beans.

I got one for $499.00 on sale during Black Friday Sales.My husband kept asking “Did you find one yet you like?”.I have and enjoying it every day. I have saved money already, making my own from home instead of buying it from a fancy bakery or cafe.  Learning how to function all the buttons takes patience.  I am thrilled with my “DeLongi Magnifica Evo”.  A gift to myself.  My first Expresso Machine.  Insuring it is always a good idea.',\n",
       "   'Love the coffee and the options. That\\'s why we bought it.Not so impressed with the frequency of \"descaling\"  and customer service was terrible! I bought it in early December. My husband opened it Christmas morning. January 15 the I reached out to customer service because the milk carafe had a crack. I was told it\\'s more than 30 days old too bad. Not impressed.',\n",
       "   \"When I visit my sister, who lives out of state, she always makes me a cappuccino in the morning. She has a manual espresso machine and frother. The quality of the cup this De'Longhi machine makes is equal to or better than the manual machine's result. Recently, we were visiting friends in Portugal and they had this machine and made us coffee with it every morning. We fell in love with it and decided to buy one when we got home. We love the variety of choices you have. One of our favorite options this machine has is the separate hopper for a measured amount of already ground coffee. This is great for making a cup of decaf espresso at night. The frothed milk is always perfect and it's self-cleaning process is great! Buy it! You'll love it!\",\n",
       "   'Wow, what a difference I\\'m actually drinking coffee now, didn\\'t know what I was missing. The De\"Longhi Magnifica Evo is very easy to operate. Just start with the coffee beans which you can grind to your like then you are off and running. I made regular coffee first and can\\'t wait to experiment with all the possibilities. I\\'ll keep you posted as I do. Now I know the difference between a latte and a cappuccino before then I thought coffee was coffee! The one-touch My Latte feature is my go-to button! I was a little intimidated and hesitant after reading the instructions but once I got started it was simple your like Oh, okay! I was asked a question about long coffee, so I made some wow what a kick!, I\\'ll stick to my latte. The De\\'Longhi Magnifica Evo is very easy to clean so don\\'t worry about bean build-up, just pull open the front drawer and dump! Like I said I was just drinking coffee now I drinking COFFEE, lattes, cappuccinos, whatever my heart desires! The more I use the machine the more I like it!',\n",
       "   'My first impression with this machine is that it is easy to get started! I literally went from unboxing to a finished latte within 10 minutes. Reading the directions is important to know everything available but you can also be a success with just a push of any button.I’ve tried every option of drink and all have so much flavor and the milk foam is perfect. I use dark roast whole beans and half & half milk which I think produces the exact latte I’m looking for with such little effort! One thing to be mindful of is that my usual tall on-the-go coffee cup does not fit under the spout. I remedy this by making it in a shorter cup and pouring it in to my larger one if I need to leave.Cleaning the machine and getting ready for the next day is as easy as a touch of a button!',\n",
       "   \"Bought this machine to replace a Saeco Incanto (without auto-milk) that recently died.  My number one concern was milk/froth temperature. I used to have to heat milk in the microwave first before frothing with the Incanto otherwise I had to steam it for minutes to get the milk to not be cold/lukewarm.  Not on this machine.  The frothed milk from the LatteCrema system was sufficiently hot for me even when the milk came directly from the fridge.Pros1. Very easy to use. My wife no longer needs to hunt me down every morning to make her a cup of latte.2. Frothed milk was hot and not lukewarm.3. Easier to clean than the Saeco Incanto.Cons1. No LED screen that can display text. Thus, the manual is required for almost all adjustments/settings.2. Cannot adjust the air/bubbliness in froth.3. No button for just frothed milk.4. The grinder could grind finer to extract more crema.Update 3/3/23: I found a trick to do frothed milk only. Press the button combination to make a latte with pre-ground coffee but don't put any coffee in the chute. The machine will make frothed milk first and then it will sense that there is no coffee in the chute and the run will be cancelled.\",\n",
       "   'The machine is very easy to set up. The instructions are easy to understand and follow, so I had no issues during set up. The water tank is located on the side and pulls out conveniently the front and you can add an optional water filter to it. You have an option of using whole or ground coffee beans. Once I finished setting it up, I thoroughly tested and tasted each type of preprogrammed coffee drinks and it came out perfect each time. The only issue is it’s a bit too noisy when grinding the coffee but at least it’s a fresh cup of coffee each time and you can adjust the temperature and coarseness of the beans to your likeness. All parts of the machine are easy to take apart and wash. If you want professional barista quality coffee drinks at home this machine is a worthy purchase!',\n",
       "   'Doesn’t take as much counter space as my old Delonghi Magnifica, but doesn’t seem as sturdy.  I like where the grinder is housed. I have to use the steam vent twice to make latte. The instructions are horrible. It took us hours to figure out how to descale. Hope we did it correctly. Also, didn’t come with the water filter that it said was enclosed. I wonder if we got one that was returned. Next time I will buy directly from Delonghi!',\n",
       "   \"I bought this product after seeing it online as one of the best super automatic machines. It works very well—easy to use, amazing taste. My only complaint is that it can leak a couple drops of water occasionally into the drink but I honestly don't think it makes a difference to the taste since it's so minimalUPDATED 1/01/24Machine unfortunately stopped sensing the milk dispenser so it was returned\",\n",
       "   'I don’t think I’ve ever opened a package faster than I did with our De’Longhi Magnifica Evo! This machine is a beauty. The instructions to put her together properly were pretty easy, and everything you need (aside from espresso beans and milk), is included. From box to espresso, it probably took me 20 minutes. I LOVE that you can make coffee or espresso drinks, or you can utilize this machine as a hot water source (I’m looking at you, tea). It’s fabulous. Since setting it up yesterday, my husband and I have had at least 6 cups of coffee. It’s absolutely splendid. If you want an easy way to enjoy barista level espresso and coffee, please do yourself a favor and buy this beauty. You will not regret it!',\n",
       "   'It makes great coffee.  If you have a staff to deal with it, buy one.- When first the power button is hit it cycles water through it.  Smart to have a mug ready to catch that water as it comes out the spout.- Randomly long after it\\'s done making the coffee it cycles water through it.  Yes, it looks totally off but then turns itself on, runs water through it, etc.  Smart to have that same mug ready to catch that water.- The grounds are deposited in two piles.  Whole bean \"patties\" are in the bin and easy to remove.  Pre-ground sit in the back of the \"drawer\" that has the discarded water in it (from the first two comments here).  Good luck emptying the water without getting grounds everywhere OR good luck throwing away the grounds without getting water everywhere.This was poorly designed.  I\\'m tempted to 3D engineer a drawer-within-a-drawer to collect the pre-ground coffee grounds so those can be tossed without spilling water everywhere.  If anyone else has a better answer please share.',\n",
       "   'We have used a DeLonghi Magnifica ESAM for over 15 years.  The first one lasted over 10 years, the second one still works great, but we decided to give it to our daughter and buy the Maginfica EVO.  Wow what an upgrade from an already great coffee maker.  It is so easy to use, to clean and to program.  Steams milk automatically and perfect every time.  Well worth the extra $100 for the LatteCrema System.Now our only issue will be when our daughter and son-in-law visit and see our new one and wonder why they got the old one and not this one... OH WELL, such is life, and right now our life is blessed with a great coffee maker!!!',\n",
       "   \"I purchased this coffee maker for the guys in my shop. Its a huge hit! everyone absolutely loves this thing.However when it came time to descale it, the coffee maker went through its cleaning cycle for about 5 hrs. It wasn't until one of my technicians found out that the low water sensor was not installed correctly. (We would never get a low water caution light when the hopper was out of water). We removed the side panel and found the low water sensor not secured with a fastener. When we installed the sensor properly the coffee maker continued on with its cleaning cycle as the instructions stated. Emailed customer service and have not heard back yet.But overall great coffee maker!\",\n",
       "   'I look forward to making a coffee EVERY SINGLE morning. Great espressos and makes delicious cappuccinos.',\n",
       "   'The media could not be loaded.We had a similar model for 3 years and it broke in a move and we decided to not spend the money replacing it and bought a simple espresso machine and had crappy cups of coffee for a month and came to our senses and replaced our Delonghi with this model, and now we go to bed every night dreaming of waking up to the perfect cup',\n",
       "   'Exactly what I was looking for and easy to use.',\n",
       "   'Seriously though, I was really on the fence for a LONG time about spending this much on a coffee maker but I have absolutely NO REGRETS. Starbucks is SO overpriced and other specialty coffee spots like Scooters are chock full of sugar. With this machine I can make any flavor of SUGAR FREE macchiatos, lates, milk teas that I want, with whatever beans I prefer for a fraction of the price.',\n",
       "   \"Due to an excellent full-color getting started guide, I found setup to be incredibly easy for this espresso machine, despite feeling overwhelmed at first. It's so easy to operate, too, and the pictures on the machine are fabulous as a reference and for guests to use. After an initial 4 espresso runs, which you're instructed to dump (much less than other espresso machines I've dealt with), the machine is primed and ready to go. Each coffee and espresso drink is ground to order (though you can use preground coffee, too), and even your milk will be steamed and frothed. The flavor of the espresso is rich and creamy, strong, but not bitter. It really makes great drinks, coffee included. One machine really can do it all.\",\n",
       "   \"The media could not be loaded.My first impression of this coffee maker was WOW, how am I going to figure all of this out to make a simple cup of coffee, or better yet, make a fancy cup of coffee? The information setup guide that was included was so easy to read that I had the machine primed and ready for that first cup of Joe in minutes. The appearance of this coffee machine can overwhelm, but when you take a step back and evaluate the machine with the instructions it becomes 2nd nature to making a good cup of coffee. The milk frothing attachment was a little tricky but working with it a couple of times gave me the confidence to froth away! I have always been a coffee drinker but usually just the basics at home, this De'Longhi Magnifica Evo has taken my coffee making to a new level with ease.\",\n",
       "   'The initial set up and run through of the De\\'Longhi Magnifica Evo™ was a bit daunting, but then with a bit of playing and some online videos the problem was resolved! On to the delicious coffee... First cup brewed, just regular coffee with a strength of \"3 beans\" and it was super strong! (no milk)... No worries with this machine if you love strong coffee... Next one, I had a cappuccino with a strength of 2 beans and frothed milk, and let me tell you... I was in heaven! The milk was thick and foamy and the coffee was strong and delish! I am so excited to have company over so I can show off and make the best coffee ever for my friends and family!',\n",
       "   'My wants me the get this product I am not the coffee lover person. But its makes me coffee lover. I am really happy to buy this product. I like the latte macchiato that is my favorite one. I highly recommend that coffee machine. It is better than the c-cup machines and way worth the money.',\n",

I appreciate that you can easily make several hot drinks, as well as choose the \"over ice\" option. The hot water option is a nice addition as well. The milk piece can be removed or added when needed, which is nice because it can be cleaned and makes the machine less bulky, but it still available to make tasty milk heavy drinks. The parts of the machine come apart easily to clean, and it\\'s easy to operate overall. I will be leaving this out on my counter and offering coffee to all guests that come over!',\n",

The instructions appear extensive, but there are points of departure between the directions and practical application.Have been using the Evo for about three months and it has worked perfectly.  You need to constantly maintain and clean it, but that needs to be understood and expected for any coffee machine.  While it's simple to use, it takes that effort to use it.The quality of coffee is good, but it's not at the same level as high end manual coffee presses.  However, if you are looking for an automatic machine that operates flawlessly (at least for 3 months) and makes good espresso and many other coffee drinks, this is a good choice.\",\n",

This grinds the beans and makes the coffee for you without much work, which was our goal. The output from your espresso machine is directly related to the quantity of the beans you put into it in the first place. so use nice beans and you will get coffee from this. Easy to set up and get going – we are really pleased with it.',\n",

Just need to constantly adjust coffee strength and grinding modes between different brand of coffee beans. Hope this last a very long time.',\n",

For this amount of money, the machine should have been perfect upon unpacking, this is a quality control issue.  Amazon would not replace with the same unit, apparently they have had multiple complaints of the same nature per customer service.  Sent it back and ordered the Phillips 3200 instead, we are happy with that selection.',\n",

       "   \"Overall, when maintained correctly (there are actually five separate parts to the milk frother which each need to be removed and cleaned separately which is not at all clear until you dig through the manual) the Magnifica Evo produces a decent cup of coffee.The controls, however, are quite frustrating to use - to get anything above luke-warm coffee you need to go into several layers of lite led combinations - all of which are a pain.  The most annoying 'feature' is that in order to perform a regular few second milk cleaning you press one button for a couple of seconds - however if you press exactly the same button for just a little longer the machine goes into 'descaling mode' which takes a minimum of 45 minutes to complete and is absolutely impossible to cancel - including unplugging the machine - even if you had performed that task just the previous day.Owning this machine is like owning a car where you press a button for a couple of seconds and it gives you the tire pressure or oil level but holding any longer turns on the check engine light which can't be turned off until you take it in for servicing.  For 'ease of use' I'd give this machine a 1/5 and for the actual coffee product (after spending your time running unnecessary and uncancelable maintenance routines) probably a 3.5/5.0.\",\n",
       "   'Like having an expresso shop in your own home.  Only negative thing I have to say is when you use the ground coffee feature it only says you can put one scoop of ground coffee. The coffee tastes a little on the weak side when you using ground coffee. But otherwise great machine',\n",

The fact it makes more than a regular cup of coffee is what first drew me in. It has all the options I could possibly need because sometimes I want something tastier like a latte. It being able to save my favorite recipes is a huge plus. The removable milk frother is very helpful for storing in the fridge until required further. I also appreciate how nice it looks with the black and silver. It’s good quality. I personally recommend.Directions to set everything up is straightforward. Not too hard.',\n",

Holy moly, we are unprepared for how good this coffee would be. Both the coffee and long espresso drinks, the only ones I’ve tried so far have been magnificent, dare I say better than the coffee we drink in Europe. The crema that comes out his rich and delicious.

It's easy to pick what type of coffee drink you like, but you will need to adjust the grind size for each type of drink. Also, you will have to steam your milk yourself.

I tried all the grinder settings, using different kinds of beans but couldn't get it to produce a consistent cup.

This also had a slightly smaller footprint than the others.I will agree with others that the instructions were well written, watch a YouTube video instead.This was comparing apples to apples with competitors’ similar machines, obviously you cannot compare to a robustness of a manual machine or the simplicity of a nespresso/pod type machine.I’m very happy with this machine and have enjoyed my morning coffee more than those darn pods!

       "\"Great product sabah95 a month ago Great product,I received this product from Influenster for free. We love this ! My husband makes me a latte everyday . thank you Influenster !! Watch out, you will become spoiled! sarahz131 a month ago I received this for free from Influenster to review with my honest opinion. This is the most amazing drink I have ever made!! It was a little difficult at first to understand the instructions. Having a really clear page labeling the buttons would have been great! I started off with making  It is a luxury machine! 33. Great product! daddybear84 27 days ago This I love it!!!!!! Great product l, if you’re a coffee lover like me! The brewing quality is very decent, grinds well. I find they it’s easy to clean, as well! Overall I really love like this set. 42. Fantastic Machine glampalette a month ago This espresso machine rules. It grinds the beans, dispenses them, makes the espresso, and steams the milk. It does everything and I love it more than any appliance in my house. It’s pretty quiet when grinding which I really like. Has double or single shot espresso option. There’s a pressure meter and a lever to adjust the coarseness of the beans. I love everything about it. I was allowed to choose from three different settings (Low, Medium and High). It was very easy to clean. Lastly, included with this espresso machine was a recipe book. I have already experimented with so many recipes. I made an Americano my, Macchiato, and the Espresso Martini. They were quite delicious. I will be continuing to experiment using other recipes. This is by far the best espresso machine I have ever used. I would highly recommend this product to all looking to make a great espresso. 22. Let your bean dreams come true vitas11 20 days ago I was really excited to get this machine and start using it. I have been searching for an espresso machine already, so the timing for receiving this was perfect. My initial impressions were that it’s very high quality and looks nice, a compact but robust size that fits snuggly under a cabinet. There was an issue with the water filter plastic encasing, unfortunately the top part of it broke and then when I opened the bottom to add a filter, one of the plastic latching pieces broke off as well, so now it doesn’t properly shut all the way. It still somewhat works, and since I use filtered water anyway I’m not too worried, just thought it was worth mentioning. I did want to take my time getting familiar with the parts and set up, so I do have one critique here that the instructions and website (linked via QR code) did lack some clarity especially when it came to priming the pump, and then also running the clean cycle. I’m still not clear on the difference between the two, I just know that water comes out of different nozzles for the cleaning cycle - so be prepared with extra cups for that (it shoots out if the steam wand last). It would have been helpful to know how many rounds to expect to go through these cycles before the machine would be ready to brew espresso, I eventually got there but the whole time I felt like I was doing something wrong. Definitely a learning curve! The last issue I had was that the water leaks from the tank in the bottom tray where the extra filters and cleaning brush live (photo attached) I clean it every time, but this happens even after its been unused for hours. But the reason for my five stars is  process. We found it quite frustrating to interpret the terms without an image explaining what each buttton and item was. We did figure it out, but it took an unnecessarily long time to do so. This is not a simple machine, so if you’re looking for something basic, this isn’t it. But if you’re willing to invest the time to learn, this machine will produce coffee shop-like results. Truth be told, we’re still learning how to use this. If you have barista experience, I’m sure this machine would exceed your expectations with its features and performance, but if you’re new to pulling espresso, be prepared to invest a significant amount of time and effort into learning the process. Buy a bag of cheaper beans in the beginning to get the hang of how to use the machine well and try out the settings to find out what suits your personal tastes. All in all we’re incredibly pleased with this machine. We probably never would have invested in a high quality espresso maker before we received this, but now we can’t imagine being without one. Absolutely well worth it and a solid investment for any coffee lover. 53. Expresso heaven. Anonymous a month ago Overall an excellent product from Kitchen-Maid. The grinding performance was phenomenal in this espresso machine. The brewing quality options are amazing. You can honestly depend on this product to perform at its highest rate. It’s easy clean up and the value of this I personally would have to say it’s worth every cent they’re asking for it. They provide a recipe book, instructions, and a QR code for more info to register the product. 54. INLFLUENSTER 👏 KEEPS 👏 SURPRISING 👏 ME! I received this KitchenAid Espresso Maker as part of a VoxBox Campaign and I swear my life is so different with this in it 😭😭 This machine is QuietMark certified meaning it’s sooooo quiet in the mornings unlike most espresso machines that would wake my whole house up at 6AM. There’s a warming pad on top of the machine that keeps my cup warm while my beans are grinding. Also paired with a steamer and hot water spout, this KitchenAid Espresso Machine is one-of-a-kind and so far the best part of my 2024! 35. Beautiful quality samantham194 28 days ago I am so thankful to have received this beautiful espresso machine! I love that it is semi automatic and I can grind fresh espresso beans. It’s easy to clean and the quality is immaculate! It has a grinder, temperature controls and even a milk steamer. I will definitely be practicing my latte making technique! 36. Great Coffee, and wonderful grinding capabilities jessicad2053 28 days ago This is awesome! This thing brews coffee better then Starbucks Coffee. Putting it together was very quick and easy. Cleaning was also easy. I believe this product is worth the money. Especially if your the person that likes to stop at Starbucks or a Coffee house in the morning. This machine will basically pay for itself. 37. Great machine! sarahm712 28 days ago What a great product to get to try out and review! It came nicely boxed, when putting it together (the water filter needed to be added) we found the added accessories in the drawer below the machine. I’m impressed with how solid this machine is. Love how easy it is to use once we figure out how to use it. We would have loved a bit more instructions or a tutorial but we in the end figured it out. I’m no barista but my first Americano turned out pretty good. It definitely will take trial and error. We would have like a bit of clarity on grind size, which filter basket is best for what, the temp settings, etc. but overall I’d definitely recommend. Perfect cup everyday and everytime. Anonymous a month ago This semi automatic Espresso machine grinds your coffee beans on the spot and thus gives an aromatic, fresh and flavorful espresso. It’s great that I can control a lot of features to make the best coffee that aligns with my taste. The steam wand gives me the creamy latte which is my favorite drink and it takes less than 3 mins for my coffee to get ready. The water tank is generous and I can make green tea or coffee whatever I desire throughout the day. It looks stylish with the stainless steel material and it’s easy to use. The instructions are simple and easy to follow. I love that we can control the grinds, steam and temperature. Highly recommend this one! 77. Love this thing! fragglerocker198 a month ago This thing is amazing! I ordered good quality brands to grind and it worked like a charm. It comes with everything you could need to make quality espresso. Cleaning was simple and easy. 78. Great easy to use espresso maker funfithealthymom a month ago This espresso machine is incredible. It makes the drinks just how you like it and is extremely customizable. The quality of the espresso is great and grinding is simple cleaning it is pretty easy. Just follow the directions. If you like espresso you will definitely like this machine. It’s definitely worth the money to purchase this espresso maker. ￼ 79. Amazing coffee! terahnicolee 6 days ago This thing is amazing! Very heavy duty and high quality. The directions are easy to read and the added recipe book was a bonus. Cleaning is a breeze and I love that it holds a lot of water so I don’t have to refill it all the time. Can’t want to continue making great morning drinks with this!  1. Amazing expresso machine! corinc 2 days ago I’m in love with this espresso machine! This is my first expresso machine & it definitely set the bar high! It looks amazing in my kitchen & makes the best drinks! Since I never used an expresso machine, I’m glad this one was a breeze to use. The instructions were informative & definitely helped me along the way. I love how it has its own burr grinder attached to it. It was easy to clean as well. I’ve made expresso shots as well as cappuccinos & can’t wait to make many more drinks. If you love coffee like myself, get this machine! It is well worth it! 2. Incredible quality and easy to use! jufriedman 2 days ago I am in loveeee with this espresso machine! I’ve never had an espresso machine before and this is so easy to use once you try it out a few times. There is built in storage for the 4 different basket types in the tray. The tray also will tell you when the water is full and needs to be dumped, which I love. You don’t need to buy a separate distributor tool after the espresso is ground because the machine does it for you! The bean hopper fits a full 12 oz/340 gram bag of beans. On top of the machine, next to the bean hopper, is a warmer that you can set your coffee on. The water tank is pretty large and I love that it has a filter in it. The milk frothed is fantastic and I love that I can just pour out hot water too if I want. The machine also comes with a very detailed handbook and a recipe booklet. Honestly, I don’t have anything negative to say about this machine. It’s a little expensive, but absolutely worth the price tag. It’s very similar to the breville machine for comparison! I love kitchen aid products though, and love that they made this machine. 3.  104. LOVE! laurens742 a month ago Huge thank you for Influenster for providing this amazing product. Make sure you read the instructions thoroughly as it is a somewhat complicated machine. Once you get the hang of it, the quality of coffee is amazing. We will definitely use this often! 105. Awesome lindsgrl25 a month ago This is going to be great to make some yummy espresso coffee drinks. The quality is amazing and looks heavy duty. It was time to upgrade to a new one. 106. Best Espresso ever! thejud a month ago This machine is the bees knees of coffee machines. From grinding your own beans to pouring the cup, this machine makes you feel like you’ve just ordered coffee from the fanciest coffee shop in town. Price is decent for the product, but the finished product makes it worth every dime. Simple to use and easy to learn. You won’t regret adding this to your kitchen attire! Grab yours today and start enjoying espressos the way they were meant to be enjoyed! 107. This is the coolest thing ever syl91 a month ago Not going to lie I was intimidated by this machine but after reading the manual and watching videos it was a lot more simple than I thought still need practice but it’s super cool and my espressos are sooo smooth and nutty tasting. I’m so thankful I got a chance at getting this. Amazing product! kiyahp1 a month ago I am a coffee fanatic and this machine is amazing. It makes the make espressos and latte.

The coffee is perfect every time, and the smell of just grounded beans in the morning is what your days need to go from 'meh' to 'life has a purpose and it is fully fulled by this machine'. 126. Quick and easy jenn__ a month ago I love how you’re able to do 2 things in one on the spot. The scent of the coffee beans grinding is amazing. It is very simple to use. I’m able to make my espresso shots all in one.  Best review yet! 122. No more starbucks!! jessicav487 a month ago I'll admit, I'm still figuring out recipes and how to set the right settings - for now I am doing basic, but man, I've NEVER had coffee this good. My heart flutters at the thought of money saved by no more starbucks AND the simple fact that this item came with a recipe book. A book that I will be utilizing for certain moods and days. Run, don't walk - to get this item! I can honestly say this item has made my life easier. It will take time for me to learn, but, I'm looking forward to it! This is ABSOLUTELY worth the purchase if you're looking into something of the sort. From temperature settings to recipes and milk brother, this is exquisite. 123. They Thought of Everything! nsand a month ago Finally, an espresso machine I can use. We replaced two separate appliances with this one machine; I never learned to use the other two machines. It is now day two with this Kitchen Aid espresso machine and I have personally made 4 cappuccinos! The start up instructions are not clear so you will have to have some espresso machine knowledge. It is wonderful to have a grinder and espresso maker in one. It comes with everything you will need; 4 espresso baskets, frothing cup and tamper AND storage for the baskets. The stainless steel is sleek and beautiful. The machine has Smart Dosing Technology which measures and grinds the perfect amount of beans for the best results every time. The portafilter has a flat base, which makes it an easier stable tamping. I especially appreciate the espresso pressure gage so you know when you’re in that espresso sweet spot. The machine has wheels! This will make it super easy for me when cleaning under and around the machine. Buy it! Smart Dosing Technology eases preparation by producing the ideal volume and consistency for 1 or 2 shots of espresso at the push of a button. \\uf0b7 Flat-Base, Commercial-Grade Easy-Tamp Portafilter \\uf0b7 58mm easy tamp portafilter is designed with recessed spouts to enable a flat base for easier, more stable tamping on a flat surface vs. a traditional residential espresso portafilter, resulting in consistent, optimal flavor and rich crema for your espresso. \\uf0b7 Multi-Angle Steam Wand  I received this product for free from Influenster andI have been extremely impressed with its performance. The machine is easy to use and produces consistently delicious espresso with a rich crema. The built-in burr grinder ensures that each shot of espresso is freshly ground for maximum flavor. The machine also has a variety of customizable settings, allowing me to adjust the grind size, brew strength, and temperature to my personal preference. The steam wand is powerful and produces velvety smooth milk foam for lattes and cappuccinos. Overall, I highly recommend the Semi Automatic Espresso Machine with Burr Grinder to any coffee lover looking for a high-quality, reliable espresso machine. It has exceeded my expectations and has become a staple in my morning routine. it. I think the stainless steel finish is stunning. Now the most important thing a consumer needs to know about this machine is “With great power comes great responsibility” this machine puts making the drink of your dreams in YOUR hands. With that being said, you need to thoroughly read and follow the instructions for first use, espresso how to’s, and also maintenance and cleaning your new machine. For first time users getting a nice espresso pull may take practice, however, there is plenty of guidance included in the literature to help you get there quickly. For those who appreciate the art of espresso over the convenience of a press and play kcup, the extra effort will be worth it. The smell of freshly ground beans in the morning, the endless ways you can personalize your drink, the satisfaction of learning a new skill… I would definitely recommend this machine to a friend. 115. Knowing how to make espressos winchestermama a month ago This shows you how to make an espresso with a grinder if that’s how you make your coffee/espressos and it shows you different beans and it also comes with a recipe book for different espresso and coffee  116. Caffeine heaven!!! dorotad9 a month ago I am a caffeine addict so I couldn't wait to set up my machine!! I am not going to lie it did take a little time to set it up but it was well worth the effort The temperature of the espresso was perfect and I loved all the different options it provides for brewing. The burr grinder was such a nice added bonus as I haven't seen many machines with this option. I also love the built in milk steamer. The quality and taste of the espresso is out of this world. I would recommend reading the instructions for the set up and for making your espresso the first few times. Good quality product that I will be using on a daily basis. I absolutely love it. 67.

Easy to use and has everything you need for the perfect espresso ceheise a month ago I absolutely love this espresso machine. It gives you so many setting adjustments to make your perfect espresso. It grinds the beans for you and measures out exactly how much you want for one or two shots. It allows you to choose the coarseness of the grind and adjust the temperature of the espresso brew. It also has a milk steamer/frother attachment that is super easy to use and works very well. I also love how it has an option to just get hot water from the machine. It heats up very quickly and is also easy to clean. I really look forward to making myself a yummy espresso drink every day! It comes with everything you need, including an easy to follow instruction manual and a recipe book. I do feel this machine is worth the price tag and it will pay for itself if you regularly buy drinks from coffee shops.

Great Cuppa Joe peder511 21 days ago So long, Starbucks! I can now make a better cup of coffee at home for a fraction of the price. I’m able to customize it the way I like it every time. It took a bit of time to assemble and figure out how to use, but the learning curve is worth it. The attention to detail takes this product to the next level. It feels high quality and heavy duty. Both the tamper and the portafilter handle are sturdy and well built. The hopper for coffee beans is handy and a great addition. I like that you can dial in the perfect amount of fresh ground coffee depending on your taste and espresso needs. If lattes are your thing, this is the product for you. 26.
